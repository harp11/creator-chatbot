Friends, 80% of people don't know that YouTube channels are of two types: Personal Account and Brand Account.  You get more benefits in a Brand Account. If you have a YouTube channel that you manage alone and you don't want anyone else to access it for titles, subtitles, or video editing, you can simply keep it as a Personal Account.  If you need to share your channel with a team, you can't give them your account, otherwise, every team member will see your earnings, growth, and everything.  If you only want someone to upload videos, they'll only have access to upload videos. And if you want to prevent someone from deleting your videos, they'll have limited access accordingly.  Firstly, if you have three or four YouTube channels and manage them alone, you'll need separate Gmail IDs.  I don't manage my five channels alone; I have a team â€“ managers, subtitlers, and other team members who manage them collectively. But I've assigned roles to each team member according to their responsibilities, so even if my main Gmail ID is compromised, I don't have to worry.  However, the biggest disadvantage is that if your account is lost due to your negligence...  If you've understood this much, you'll easily understand how to create a Brand Account and assign roles. It's crucial to understand this.  Just click here (referring to a visual element not described in text), and you'll see the option. Simply click on "Manage Permissions." After clicking, you might be asked for your password. Then you can see Nunu Tiwari, Hawasin Manager, along with the Primary Owner. My main YouTube channel login is on my mobile phone, and I have full rights. The owner can remove a manager, but not the primary owner; they can't be removed or changed.
