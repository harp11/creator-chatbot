Friends, every month I receive 200-300 emails on my YouTube channel, where brands ask me what kind of videos I upload on my YouTube channel. But imagine if we had a sheet where everything is already written, and it gets updated every week, every month, according to our YouTube channel. And this feature is provided by none other than YT Studio, Official YouTube, and very few people know about it. First, what you'll do is open YT Studio in your mobile phone in desktop mode, okay? After doing this, you will simply go to the Monetization section. After going there, at the very end, you will simply tap here. And as you tap here, an interface like this will appear in front of you: Welcome to Brand Connect, and here it shows Media Kit. Now, as you tap on View Media Kit, I'll explain to you how. If you look here, my YouTube channel name, logo, subscribers, and about section are all written in one place. After that, demographics, meaning my videos, and if you come a little to the side, look above, subscribers, lifetime, how many? Videos published, how many videos have been published lifetime? Watch time, how much watch time in hours? In a way, everything that brands need to know is written on one page. Now, there's another question that brands ask most often: with which brands have you worked before? Now we don't have to do anything, simply tap on Download PDF above, and the entire page will come to us in PDF format, just send it to the brand. You will have to go back to Brand Connect, slide, and here, set suggested price, business contact email, here you will have to add your commercials. If you add them here, they will also be added to your Media Kit. So my work has become much easier with this. How did you find this feature? You can tell me in the feedback.
