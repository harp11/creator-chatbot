Friends, nowadays AI has become so incredibly advanced that you can create music, images, videos, or any sound effects you want using a single application. But have you ever thought whether the AI you're using has a license for any content it generates? No, right? So how can we say that any content generated by AI is 100% safe?  Every creator should watch today's episode. In today's episode's last 30 seconds, I've shared some tips for using AI content with 100% safety. If you use these tips, you'll never face any problems.

Secondly, there's content that's offered for free commercially, but you have to pay to use it – like Envato, Freepik, or Storyblocks. When you download any file from these platforms, a license is also provided.  And thirdly, there's the content you're currently using in your videos, generated by AI.  Here, the most important thing to understand is that if we use images, videos, or music from Pixabay, Mixkit, or Pexels – which are 100% royalty-free websites – the chances of a copyright strike are very low.  Even if a strike comes in the future, you can remove it by submitting the license.

But, the content you create using AI, no website takes responsibility for it, and you don't have any license.  So what should we do if that's the case? But people are using AI, so why can't we? Now, let me answer this question in detail and explain how we can use AI content safely.  If you create any song or sound effect, make sure it doesn't match any popular Hollywood or Bollywood song. If it does, avoid using such images.

Tip number four: Carefully read all the terms and conditions of the platform you're using to generate AI images before using that content.
