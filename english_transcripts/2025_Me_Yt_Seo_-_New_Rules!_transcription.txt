In 2025, YouTube underwent many changes. New rules and updates were implemented, and significant algorithm changes occurred.  Because of this, YouTube video SEO must be done very carefully.  Keeping in mind the latest rules, regulations, news, updates, and algorithm changes of 2025, I'm going to give you a practical YouTube SEO tutorial. I'll explain the mistakes you shouldn't make so that you can get organic traffic to your videos with 100% safety, grow your channel, and succeed. In the last minute, I've highlighted five major mistakes you absolutely shouldn't make in your video titles, tags, and descriptions in 2025. So don't miss the end; now let's begin.

Friends, as you all know, until now people used to upload any kind of content on YouTube, whether right or wrong, just to make money.  If you don't pay attention to YouTube's rules in your video titles, tags, and descriptions, your videos won't rank, and they might even be deleted. Don't make back-to-back videos on the same title unless it's a series or episode. Otherwise, YouTube will think you're creating repetitive content.

Mistake #3: Use only those tags that are relevant to the video's content. Many people mislead YouTube by using irrelevant tags, which you absolutely shouldn't do.

Mistake #4:  Avoid using certain words in your videos (the specific words are not listed in the original text).

Mistake #5 (and most important): Keep your titles short and clickable to get more clicks.

Regarding thumbnails:  Using inappropriate thumbnails can lead to YouTube taking two actions:  first, deleting your thumbnail; second, applying a Community Guidelines strike and deleting your video.
