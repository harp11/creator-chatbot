Friends, I know that if you work on YouTube, this application, YT Studio, will be in your phone. But do you know that if you understand it very well, like when you open YT Studio in your mobile phone, the first interface you'll see is the Channel Analytics tab.  In very short, you can see how many views your channel has received in the last 28 days. You can also read YouTube channel views in more detail: in the last 7 days, last 28 days, or the last 90 days, how your views have increased or decreased. Along with that, in the tab shown below, you can also check which video brought the most views in a particular time period.  And it's a simple thing: keep making videos that perform best, because this will show everyone which videos to make and which not to make. Now, just as you read the views, similarly, by touching post time, subscribers, and revenue, you can read all of these for that time period clearly. Now, let's try to understand even more advanced tools in detail.  When you touch Analytics, the Overview tab will open first. But the best performing ones...it's simple: if you make such videos, your subscribers will watch more, and your YouTube channel will grow rapidly. That's why low interest is written here. And if I search here for "make money online," you will see that it shows "very high interest."  That means my subscribers want to watch videos on this topic. So, it's simple: you have to make those videos.  Although you've probably figured out almost everything, there are some other things you should know, without which everything will seem incomplete. When are they active?  Meaning, when do they watch videos? Like around 11 PM, meaning around 12 at night. This color is completely filled; this means my subscribers are watching videos at this time. In this video, I have explained the most important tools you should know. And by just looking at the basic tools, you can easily get an idea of how they work.
