Friends, today I'm going to tell you about three YouTube channel ideas where you only need to work two or three hours a day. You can do all the work alone, meaning you don't need very professional scripting. The first channel idea is a "Top Five" type YouTube channel. You can create any kind of video, like "Top Five Horror Movies" or "Top Five Toys for Kids," "Top Five [Anything]." For example, you can see this YouTube channel with 2 million subscribers; they have uploaded only 521 videos. And if you go to their videos, you'll see they don't have very professional thumbnails or titles. How did they make videos? "Top Five Fans," "Top Five Bugs," "Top Five [Something]"â€”quality videos.  They just take whatever is available on the internet and make a "Top Five" video out of it. They are only getting around 6,000-30,000 views, meaning not very many views. But if you go a little further back and look, you see 91,000 views. And if I go to the popular section and react to those videos, judging whether they are good or bad.  And friends, now let's talk about the third YouTube channel idea, which you can maintain even if you only work one day a week. We call these ASMR videos. Now, what are ASMR videos?  You can show the chopping of any particular thing, and record its chopping sound very clearly. Show it with proper capturing and visuals. Let's understand with an example. This is a YouTube channel, "Oddly Satisfying," with 4.25 million subscribers. Now you'll ask, sir, why are there so few videos? The correct answer is that if you make ASMR videos, whether you have fewer or more subscribers doesn't matter, but if your videos are good...
