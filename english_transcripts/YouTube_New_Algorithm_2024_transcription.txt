What exactly happened on YouTube all of a sudden? Some people's views have drastically decreased, while others have seen a massive increase. And how can I take advantage of this and get far ahead of others? Between November 1st and November 15th, my YouTube channel saw a 50% decrease in views, and a 75% decrease in YouTube earnings. And I'm 100% sure this happened to you too, because YouTube's new algorithm... not only that, but now you can increase your earnings and do everything you couldn't do before.  Meaning, increase views to earn more money. Only 0.1% of people know about this, and by taking advantage of it, you can get ahead of others. So don't skip the last part at all. Now, let's begin.
