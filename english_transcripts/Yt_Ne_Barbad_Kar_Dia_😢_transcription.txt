Friends, today's video is for all those who want to become a successful YouTuber and fulfill their dreams. Before starting the video, look at this: this is a YouTube channel that has 150 million subscribers today. At one time, every video on this channel used to get millions of views. The first mistake is to act arbitrarily, the biggest example of this is WIFI STUDY. There was a time when this channel was the lifeline of students. Perhaps there is no student who hasn't studied from here. Their focus was only on keeping subscribers happy. But when the engagement on the channel decreased, Unacademy bought it. After that, they started making changes according to their own terms on the channel. And one should think about long-term growth rather than short-term benefits. The second mistake is negligence, and the freshest example of this is SBJ Classics. To work on YouTube, it is not enough to just make videos and grow the channel. It is also necessary to pay attention to the platform's rules and regulations.  Many rules were being violated on the SBJ Classes channel. Last, and the most important tip: don't be dependent. Many people just rely on YouTube, and if anything goes wrong on the channel, generate side income so that you don't face any problems in the future. And as your channel grows, your options should also expand. Don't rely on just one platform, diversify. How did you like the content?  Tell me in the feedback. Thanks for watching.
