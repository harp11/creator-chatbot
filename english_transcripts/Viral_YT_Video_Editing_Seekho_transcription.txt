Professor of how even now, new and many big creators, alongside me, follow a pattern for editing their videos, which is why all our content performs so well. Now, if you also edit your videos somewhat, then you should never make these three mistakes mentioned in this video, otherwise, even your good videos will perform poorly. Mistake No. 1: Wrong Use of SFX. You must have seen many creators on Instagram using various sound effects in their videos, like this video of NSB Pictures, which makes their videos seem very distinctive, and people get annoyed by the SFX and stop watching your videos. The solution is to understand the vibe of your video before doing this. Mistake No. 2: Psychology. And this is a mistake it took me about four years to recognize. Earlier, I too, like all of you, used to think that to make a video viral, you have to do very high-quality video editing, meaning that even if you do less video editing, whatever visuals you use should be so solid that they are 100% related to your content. If this ever happens to you, keeping time management in mind, proper editing couldn't be done on those phobias, and in the cycle of making it perfect, you don't realize when two or three hours have passed. If so, you have to think about doing such editing on a frame-by-frame basis where the user simply understands what you're saying. And friends, now I'll tell you about those three secrets. By doing this, your branding will also be built, and the work will also be very fast. Second, think about editing the video in such a way that even if someone watches your video without sound, so that your video always looks professional. By keeping all these things in mind, you too can edit your videos very professionally. Thanks for watching.
