Friends, YouTube has done an amazing job. Now they've given us a feature where we can use three different thumbnails for a single video. YouTube will then tell us which thumbnail is good and which is bad.  Hello friends, I'm Hawasing, welcome to Seekho Official Show YouTube Secrets. Let's learn something new today. So friends, first, on your phone or desktop, when you do this, you'll get an edit option where you can add the title, text, description, everything. What we have to do, watch very carefully. We'll zoom into the thumbnail section, and after going there, we'll touch the thumbnail. In fact, we'll see some new things, which are explained in the last 30 seconds, so keep watching. Now look, if I zoom out, you'll see here, we have not one but three different thumbnails.  Someone will see the first thumbnail, someone the second, someone the third. And after fifteen days, it will tell us which thumbnail is performing best. Now you'll say, the thumbnail with the most clicks. If I zoom in on reach, then you'll see here, the thumbnail test is being shown to me. Now, it's not telling me here how much CTR each thumbnail is getting. But instead of telling us the CTR, why is YouTube telling us watch time? So YouTube says you can get clicks on the thumbnail. You can write anything on the thumbnail, you'll get clicks. So friends, today you learned something new, so like this video and subscribe to the channel. Thanks for watching.
