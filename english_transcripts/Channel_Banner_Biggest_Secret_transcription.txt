Very few of you will know that the banner you see on YouTube can increase your earnings, increase your Instagram followers, or even get you sponsorships. So let's learn some new things today. First, the importance of a YouTube banner. Your YouTube banner is not just an image, but your brand identity. Whenever a new visitor comes to your channel, the first things they see are your channel name and tagline so people understand what your channel is about, your upload schedule so people know how often you upload new content, and a clean and professional look so that anyone can understand at first glance what they will find on your channel. Because not everyone watches all your videos or the entire channel the first time. The YouTube banner size is 2560 x 1440 pixels, but the parts visible on mobile and desktop are different. Therefore, any important information or graphics should be placed centrally. You can download this PNG file and place it on your banner.
