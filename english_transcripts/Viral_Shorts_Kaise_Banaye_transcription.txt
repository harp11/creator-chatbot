Absolutely practical, today I'll tell you how you can make a viral YouTube Short. This is not a theoretical video, but I'm going to share real examples and tested strategies with you. Welcome to Seeko Official Show YouTube Secrets. Now let's begin. These are the three universal methods through which anyone can make a viral YouTube Short, and the last one is my favorite.

Method No. 1: Viral Music. The first thing is to find trending music. Now, see, trending music here isn't what has millions of views on a single short video. Rather, trending music is that on which almost all the shorts made are viral. And then see how many videos made on that track have gone viral. For example, as you can see on the screen right now, short videos made on this music have gotten 99 million views, which is just amazing. You just have to do this much:  take the top ten to twenty videos and make the best short video among them. And if you do this, nothing can stop your short from going viral.

Go to the YouTube Shorts feed, start scrolling, and see what people like to watch. What's engaging? What's unique? If you want to grow quickly and make shorts viral, you have to do something different from other people. You can also analyze multiple creators like this and see on which themes content is being created that is getting good views.

Method No. 3: Swipe Through Analysis â€“ the most powerful and my favorite. This method is technical, but it's the most impactful. When you make a short video, the YouTube algorithm only pushes it when people watch the video completely, not when they swipe through. So your aim, your target, should be to create a good hook in your short video. If your storytelling is good and you use visual elements well, the viewer is compelled to watch your video. Engagement on your video increases, and only then can a short video go viral.
