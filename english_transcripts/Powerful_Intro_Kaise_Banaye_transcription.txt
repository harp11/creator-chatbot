YouTube gives you a great opportunity to make your videos viral, but you don't take advantage of that opportunity. You don't understand what you're doing wrong. And by the time you understand what mistake you've made, even a bad video can be made viral with a good intro. In fact, your every word decides whether your video will be a hit or a flop. And today we are going to understand this game in depth.  In the first line of the intro, create an emotional suspense with the audience, just like I did at the start of this video's intro. Let's rewind and see it once. YouTube gives you a great opportunity. Just one line. This one line will make every YouTuber think, "What opportunity? I never got one. Or did I ever get one?" A suspense will be created in the viewer's mind. In the second line, whatever content you are thinking of creating, you will also have to find out what the audience wants. What is it that the audience is searching for the most related to that title? Now, in the third line, you have to find the biggest weakness of the viewer who is watching the video you have chosen the title for. And this was the line that compelled all of you to watch this video this far. And that's because I know my viewers' every weakness and strength. The fourth line of the intro should be such that once someone hears it, they should regret their mistakes and feel that they would lose a lot if they didn't watch your video.
