Friends, you won't believe I created this thumbnail in just three minutes, without AI, without any template, 100% free! Today, I'm going to show you step-by-step how to make this thumbnail using a mobile phone. You will search for and download all the photos and graphics you want to use on the thumbnail.  Because this website provides you with 100% free, copyright-free content. After that, first, by touching this button, you will delete the unwanted text. Now we need a background image; for that, if we touch the fourth option and then select the image from the gallery that we want to use as the background. Now we need a photo of a rich man to place on top of this background. After that, just place the image wherever you want on the thumbnail. By scrolling this toolbar and using this stroke button, you can also give a white border around the image. Now we need an image of money that will appear above the background and below this rich man. So, we just have to touch anywhere empty on the thumbnail. To add text, just touch this second tool, and then by touching the plus sign, you can write whatever text you want on your thumbnail here. Now let's give this thumbnail a slightly more professional look. By sliding the toolbar, you have to find the background option and whatever background you want to put behind the font. Now I want a white glow effect behind my character's face. To do this, I will download a glow image PNG from Google. Similarly, we will add the rest of the fonts that we want to add to the thumbnail. And now comes the last and final effect, which is my favorite. Now look, sometimes, just changing the background changes the whole vibe of the thumbnail. So I'm going to show you that. After that, you have to find this section using the slider. Now you see, as I move the slider, how quickly the thumbnail's background color is changing.
