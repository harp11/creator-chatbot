But what was in this video that made 100% of people interested in watching it?  Could we also make a one-second video and get it viral? And what's the minimum length short video you can make? We're going to deeply explore all these questions in today's video. Because this video is even a third of a second, meaning as soon as someone saw this video, it played two or three times in one second. Because of this, the video's audience retention naturally became 300%.  Make a one-second video and go viral. Is this 100% true? The answer is no. Not all videos go viral. Only some videos go viral, and only those videos go viral which get good engagement, meaning good likes, shares, and comments. So, if you also want to use the one-second method in your videos, make it so that a user doesn't even realize when your video started and ended.
