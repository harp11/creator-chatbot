Friends, my video has received 60,000 views, and the most interesting thing is that 76% of the traffic is from YouTube search, meaning from external sources where I promoted this video for free and generated traffic.  And the best/last method, which I myself follow even today, is the reason my video got so many views and engagement.  This might be a question whose answer you won't find on Quora. Here, you can promote your YouTube videos for free, but how? Let's find out. First, whatever category your YouTube video is in, you have to find questions related to that topic on Quora and paste your YouTube video link in the answer to that question. But don't put a direct link. First, write some context, and if there's a topic with the most votes that you haven't made a video on, you can create a dedicated YouTube video on that topic and share it there.  The second method is Pinterest. Pinterest gives a great opportunity. First, create a fresh YouTube account on Pinterest.  On the homepage, tap the plus icon and upload your YouTube video thumbnail here. Just pasting daily links won't work. You have to make your profile look genuine. So make 50% of your posts without links. These posts should be related to your content category. I'm not going to tell you its name right now, I'll tell you in a few days, but before that, let's understand how this works. It's a powerful tool that helps you promote your YouTube video through organic methods.  Then lastly say, friends, by clicking on the related video, you can watch our full video. Upload one version of this short video to YouTube Shorts and another to Instagram. Here, ManyChat is used. Whenever people comment on Instagram, ManyChat will send them your video link via DM, meaning you don't have to do anything manually; everything will happen automatically. You can search for this, this, and this title and see the whole thing. How did you like the content?  Tell me in the feedback. Thanks for watching.
