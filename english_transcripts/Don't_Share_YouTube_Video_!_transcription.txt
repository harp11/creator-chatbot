The best way to increase views on new YouTube channels is to simply share your videos with your friends and family, and the views will come automatically.  If you look at where people have watched your video after watching it, you'll see where people have watched it.  Now, it may seem like only 2%, but the organic views on this video are 1.2 million.  Meaning, 2% is a huge number. 2% of 1.2 million is 20,000 views, which is not normal.  So many people watched my video through links, and yet my video went viral. But how true is this, when does it work, and what's the solution? Let's discuss it.

So look, what do new YouTubers do? They go on WhatsApp and share their videos with all their contacts. Then they put the video on their status. And after putting it on their status, all their contacts...the answer is, doing this is absolutely not right. Let's understand this practically.  Now, it's not like you all make comedic videos or funny videos.  The viewer will touch your video, watch it for 10-15 seconds, and if they don't like it, they'll dislike it, maybe comment, and close the video. But in this case, YouTube will think your video is not good. People are coming, watching, but not interested; they skip after ten seconds and leave. Now imagine, if people watched my video for more than ten seconds, would YouTube promote it? Absolutely not.  And this is what we should understand: we shouldn't always share our videos.

Look, you know that sharing videos isn't wrong at all. So we can share it, but in a way. On WhatsApp, what can we do? Simply tap on the plus button. Now, if you have one contact, two contacts, or however many contacts, select them one by one.  Then your link will only reach those fifty people who are interested in watching your video. And the chances are, if they play the video, they'll watch it for longer.  And you should do the same thing on Facebook. Share your videos only in dedicated groups interested in your content. By doing this, whatever videos you make...
