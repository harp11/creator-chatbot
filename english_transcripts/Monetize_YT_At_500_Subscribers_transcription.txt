Friends, do you know that you can monetize your YouTube channel even with 500 subscribers? If you don't know, I'm telling you with 100% surety. I'm making this episode because yesterday I was checking all your feedback, where I found a question that sir, my channel has 500 subscribers, but I haven't received the YouTube Partner Program mail. If you also have a good topic that can benefit everyone, you can request feedback from me; I will make a dedicated video on it. Along with these two, you will have to complete three thousand hours of watch time on your channel or get three million views on shorts in 90 days. If you complete this milestone, YouTube will allow your subscribers to send you Super Chat/ Stickers. That means whenever you go live, or if a viewer likes your video, they can send you money ranging from ₹20 to ₹9999. And this is also not a type of monetization, but wait, there's one factor missing in all this, which is YouTube Ads. Yes, those ads that are displayed on your video before it plays, from which the earning is the highest and is the main source of earning. For that, you will have to scroll down and get 1000 subscribers on your channel, along with completing 4000 hours of watch time or 10 million views in the last 90 days.
