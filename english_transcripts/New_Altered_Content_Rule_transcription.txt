Whether you have five subscribers or five lakh (hundred thousand), it's crucial to mention in your videos whether your content is altered or not.  First, let's understand what altered content is.  It's not that if you used something for even a second, you'll have to say yes.  When to say yes and when to say no is a big grey area, which we'll discuss later.  Now, we all know that there are so many AI tools in the market whose results are unbelievable. Let's understand all that step-by-step.  YouTube is doing this so that the viewer knows they are watching AI-generated content. Now, if your content is synthetic, you can make your face as beautiful as you want, no problem. But if you digitally generate an image using AI commands,  and then change the background of a car using AI, you don't need to mention that you used AI. That's fine, that's normal. But if you've completely changed a character from a movie to the point that your video uses AI to make it not seem 100% real, then you need to mention it. Third, they are saying that if you modify a pre-recorded audio, you don't have to mention it. So do we need to mention it there? Absolutely not. But if you've generated a video of a missile that doesn't exist in real life, or generated any footage that doesn't exist, meaning any footage, music, or video that doesn't exist in real life and might mislead someone, then you must mention it. You'll see this yes/no option when you upload the video. And once the video is uploaded, the user will know with a pop-up while watching the video. Because I read all your feedback very carefully.
