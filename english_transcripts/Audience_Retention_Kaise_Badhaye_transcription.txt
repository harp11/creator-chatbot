Friends, if someone asks me to explain in one word what's most important for making YouTube videos viral, do you know what my answer would be? My answer would be AVD, AVD meaning Average View Duration. Now you might be wondering why this AVD is so important? And this year we reached an AVD of 3 minutes 10 seconds, and our target is to take it to 4-5 minutes by the end of 2025. Now you might be thinking why so much effort? What's the benefit of boosting AVD? If you have your own YouTube channel or if you want to start one, understanding AVD is as important as completing 1000 subscribers and 4000 watch hours for monetization. So first, let's talk about what AVD actually is, how it works, and how you can improve it and grow your channel. AVD also means how much of your video a viewer watches on average.  When you tap on analytics, you'll first see how many people are still watching after 30 seconds of your video; for example, 57% of viewers are still watching. Here, you need to remember one rule: if this percentage is above 50%, then your video... this graph will show you which parts of the video people are consistently watching and which parts they are skipping. Where there's a major drop, you need to understand what mistakes we made that caused viewers to leave. Besides this, there's another metric: Average Percentage Viewed. This means what portion of your video a viewer is watching. The higher this is, the more YouTube will recommend your video. Now let's talk about the overall channel's AVD, where you can check out your channel's average view duration, what your overall channel's AVD is. If your target is to boost it, you'll have to make your videos longer, like 8-9 minutes.
