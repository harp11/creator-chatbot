Friends, whenever you upload a video on YouTube, you always get an option that you have to choose yes or no for, which is about License and Distribution.  Let's look at it once. The first option is the Standard YouTube License, then Distribution, then Allow Embedding, and below that is another one. You should know the meaning of all four if you are a YouTube video creator. So first, let's understand the License.  So here, on YouTube, we have two different types of licenses. If I simply tap here, the first option that comes up is the license, which is the Standard YouTube License. In this, if you upload any video, then nobody can use your video without your permission, meaning they can't reuse it without your permission.  You grant access to a creator to use your content if you upload the video under Creative Commons. And in the Standard YouTube License, you have all the rights. If you're thinking, "I have an Envato subscription, so I'll download some footage and upload it to YouTube and upload it as Creative Commons," then...

After that comes Distribution, and Distribution is not useful for Indian people. Here we see four or five different options.  If this is ticked, then your video can be played directly on any website. You give someone the option to embed it. Now, what are the advantages and disadvantages? A dedicated episode can be made on this, which we will discuss sometime later. But this fourth option is the most impactful. There are some topics that we don't want our subscribers to see, otherwise, growth can decrease. So here, you can untick this and upload the video.
