This is the official YouTube channel of Rabish Kumar, and if you play and watch any of his videos, like I'm playing this video right now, his videos start with someone else's video.  They come in with "beeps" and talk about the video before leaving.  And by doing this, they create 40-40 minute videos. Similarly, CarryMinati takes other people's TikTok videos and Instagram videos and adds something special that you can't skip.  

Hello friends, I'm Hawa Singh, and welcome to "Seekho Official Show YouTube Secrets". Let's learn something new today. First, like here, these two people are sitting, and we'll play a video below, just watch the video, give a reaction, and their YouTube channel is monetized. You can see their subscribers.  So look, YouTube says that anyone can give you a strike, but there are some fair use policies. That means if you've used someone else's content in a limited portion of your video—now, as they've played the video, you can use copied content in 30% of the entire video—and in the remaining 70%, you can show your own face.  In that case, a strike can come on your channel.

Second, when you search on YouTube, "no face, no voice, YouTube channel ideas," you'll find many good channels. If you're thinking that without effort, without creativity, I will just copy-paste content and monetize it, then this is your biggest misconception. And even if it gets monetized by mistake one day, when it will be demonetized, you should think about it. If you could make money doing this, then why wouldn't Pixsa itself make money? Therefore, whatever video you make, if you have to copy someone's content, you can cut a small portion and put it in your video. In that, we can tell YouTube that look, we are taking an example here, explaining it to everyone; YouTube won't give a strike on your channel. The content will also be made, and if the other person approves this, then the content can be used—meaning, in a way, you're taking permission to use the content.

Third, there are some government sources from which even if you copy-paste content, there's no problem, like national TV. The conclusion of today's video is that there is no direct way to copy someone else's content, put it in your video, and monetize it, because if the other person wants, they can give you a strike anytime.
