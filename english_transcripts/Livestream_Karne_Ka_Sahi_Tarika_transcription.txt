If you go live on YouTube twice a week, you can grow a dead YouTube channel, double your audience engagement, increase views on your videos, and monetize your channel sooner. But the problem is that people don't know whether they should do a vertical livestream or a horizontal livestream, what are the advantages and disadvantages of each. Now, I know that 90% of my audience watches videos from their mobile phones, so I'll show you how to livestream from a mobile phone. First, you'll open the YouTube app. On mobile, you can livestream in two ways: one is vertical, which I'm currently doing, and the other is horizontal, meaning tilting the phone. You can do a horizontal livestream. So which one should you do? Because if you do a vertical livestream here, your videos will also go into the Shorts feed. Let me show you how. I've come to the YouTube interface. Now look, I'm going to close this now because there's nothing to show inside it. Look, now if someone wants to watch Shorts, your livestream will also appear to them. After that, we'll talk about other things. Let's go to the live tab. Here, a scheduling option is given. What is this? If you want to not livestream now, do it at 7 PM. You always have to keep in mind that whatever type of live you do, don't do a vague title for it. After that, we need to make it unlisted, public, and then here, "Made for kids." If you select yes here, your video will only be shown to children and not to adults, and it might be that...  We go back and after coming here, the description. People never take this seriously, but look, I've managed it properly. It's properly written here. Below that is location; we don't need to add this. After that, advanced settings, and here we only need monetization; if yours is enabled, then enable it. After that, keep the orientation vertical, go back. After doing this, there's another mistake that many people make: when your livestream goes into someone's browser, it's your thumbnail that attracts anyone. Now I'll tell you some pro tips that you should know if you go live, and those pro tips are that you should try to keep your audience engaged in the livestream as much as possible. If you follow these tips, even if you have only five viewers, you will still reach a larger audience who haven't subscribed to you.
