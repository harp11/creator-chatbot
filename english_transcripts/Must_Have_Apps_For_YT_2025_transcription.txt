Friends, whether you want to create content on YouTube, write a script for a video, edit a video, or create a YouTube video, you can use AI to make your work faster and grow your YouTube channel faster. So, if you are a content creator and make videos on YouTube, let's look at our first application today.  The name of the application is ChatGPT, and why you should have it will be obvious to all of you. You need it to find content, create a channel name, generate images. You must have sometimes noticed that we sometimes need visuals that we don't find on Pixabay or Pexels. So, what can you do? Simply come to this application, write whatever kind of visuals you want.  If you want it in 3D, realistic, 2D, whatever kind of video you want, just tell it, and according to your needs, it will provide you with the video.

The third application is Pixabay, and this application should be on all your phones because if you need corporate pre-video, a photo, music, sound effects... Now, because I'm telling you about free tools, some people may not know about it, so I've integrated this application here for them. You can do all your work very easily here. In fact, you also get template-based editing here, and unlike CapCut, you won't face network issues repeatedly.

Now, the five applications I'm going to tell you about are the most common, meaning almost everyone has them on their phones. But still, I've seen some people who work on YouTube but haven't downloaded these essential apps. Download these apps immediately because without them you won't be able to work on your YouTube channel.

And I've integrated this application because if you add any work offline in it, it will automatically be saved online. You can see your phone's things on the computer and your computer's things on your phone. So we have Premiere Pro and other tools, but in mobile phones, you don't get many tools for editing audio in video editors like KineMaster or CapCut. All professional tools are available in this.

Now friends, let's talk about today's ninth application, and after that, we'll talk about my favorite application. So the ninth application is Pixel Lab. All the thumbnails you're seeing, I made them all with Pixel Lab, from a mobile phone, but they look like they're made in Photoshop. If you learn this application well... Yes, for limited features, they ask you for money, but even without those, you can create professional thumbnails. And friends, now let's talk about today's last and final tool regarding YouTube SEO.  It also has many other tools that are very important for a YouTuber to have. So friends, these were ten different essential applications that every content creator should have.
