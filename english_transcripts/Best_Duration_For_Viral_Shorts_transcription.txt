How many seconds long should shorts be to go viral? This is a question I've been asked a lot in feedback. More than 200 of the most popular YouTube Shorts have over 200 million views.  So that your shorts can also go viral quickly, and yes, don't miss the conclusion in the last 30 seconds of the video, because I've summarized the entire video there. So don't miss the end. Now let's begin.

Video number one is a video where a person stands with a balloon in one hand and a pin in the other. Every second, the viewer thinks he's going to puncture the balloon. Simultaneously, his facial expressions are such that it looks like he's about to do something mischievous. And that's enough of a hook to keep people watching the short. This short was uploaded to the Colin's Shorts YouTube channel, and its duration is 41 seconds.

Video number two is a video that has 1.53 billion views.  Instantly, within one second, he approaches a random girl and offers her $100 if she completes a task. Upon her refusal, he offers the next person $300. This video was uploaded to the MrBeast YouTube channel and is 47 seconds long. Within a second, she hides, with a special expression that suggests she's about to do something. Instantly, she removes one dress, and within 3 seconds, she's in a different dress. This actual sequence continues back-to-back. One wonders how many dresses she changed into, and what will happen at the last second?  People watch the video to the end to see this. The video title is "Real Life Transforming Cinderella Dress," which has received 1.78 billion views.

Now let's talk about how we should make shorts. In the first 3 seconds, create curiosity in the viewers' minds.  Maintain that curiosity until the last second of the video to achieve 100% retention.  The short's content should attract younger audiences.  Finally, keep the short's length between 30 seconds and one minute, as much as possible.
