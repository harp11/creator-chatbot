There's a new update on YouTube that, if ignored, could negatively impact your channel, reducing both views and earnings.  Similar to how Shorts reduced long video views, this is a significant change. Welcome to Seeko Official Show YouTube Secrets. Now let's begin.  First, let's understand this new feature: it's YouTube Playable.  This is a new YouTube section where users can play over 50 games directly, without downloading, free of ads and interruptions.  Just as Shorts drastically reduced long video views, these games will now grab user attention.  Subscribers previously had limited options. Now, with limited time, will they play games or watch your videos? And because games are more addictive than your videos (as platforms want users to spend more time in their apps), this is working against our views.  So, how do we avoid this situation? You need to make your content more engaging.  Include content that compels viewers to watch your videos. Value your subscribers' time, understand your audience according to your content, and adapt your content to their needs over time.  And stay aware of the impact of this new feature.
