No matter how good a thumbnail is, if you don't know the three settings of a YouTube thumbnail, your thumbnail will appear blurry to others on YouTube. If this happens, people will click less. After stabilizing different types of YouTube channels, I have found three patterns that are common in all channel thumbnails. Now I will show you two thumbnails for three seconds, and you have to decide which one you understood faster.  I bet you understood thumbnail one faster, but why? The answer is bold and readable text. Whenever a new YouTuber creates a thumbnail, they make this mistake. Let's again take some feedback from you. Which of these two thumbnails do you like more? The first one or the second one? Here too, your answer will surely be thumbnail one, but why? Similarly, while creating a thumbnail, the font and background colors should be different so that it is easily visible and eye-catching. Using the color wheel, you can understand which color will be best with which background. Point no. 3: Resolution or dimension, which is asked before you create a thumbnail, like 1280 x 720, 1920 x 1080, or 4k resolution. Now everyone thinks that the higher the resolution, the better the thumbnail will be, but this is not the case because YouTube has its own image compression system where whatever thumbnail you upload, it converts it to 1280 x 720p. And if in the meantime your thumbnail is at a very high resolution or with the wrong settings, then whenever you create your YouTube thumbnail, first export your thumbnail to 1280 x 720 resolution and then upload it to YouTube. Then there will be no problem.
