If you haven't done vertical livestreams on your YouTube channel yet, friend, this might be your biggest mistake so far. Why? You'll find out by watching this episode completely. Not only that, there are many YouTube channels whose videos only get 300-400 views, but their livestreams get millions of views. And why should we start vertical livestreams on our channel today? First, by doing livestreams, you can directly communicate with your subscribers. Because of this, you get 100-200 hours of watch time easily from one video. And if you livestream consistently for 30-40 days, your YouTube channel can be monetized within a month. And the best part is, if you do these livestreams in vertical mode, your livestream will start appearing on the homepage, suggestions, and short feeds.

Click on the 'create' button, select 'live' from here. Keep in mind that if you are going live on your YouTube channel for the first time, you will have to submit a request, after 24 hours of which you will be able to go live on your channel. Then tap on this pen icon and give your video an engaging title. After that, make the visibility public and go to advanced settings and allow both these options. After doing this, you have to go back and then tap on next, and then tap on next again. Now here you will get an option to upload the thumbnail. Again, tap on this pen and upload an engaging thumbnail for your livestream. And after doing this, you are ready to go live.  Keep in mind that after following this process, you will only go live, but to keep more and more people engaged in the live stream, you should choose a topic for your live stream accordingly. Also, if you want to increase the power of live stream by 10x, you can run this livestream 24x7, even with automation tools.
