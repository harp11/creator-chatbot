Friends, is it possible to go from zero to 100 subscribers on a YouTube channel in just one day? You might think it's impossible, but the answer is, absolutely yes! Today I'll tell you the tips I gave my brother. This video's secret is a 30-second trick that's 100% working, so watch the video till the end. Hearing this, I thought, what can we expect from so few people? But then I used my brain and created a plan that made my brother happy dancing. YouTube promotes your first video the most, and this is a chance we all need to take advantage of. We need to plan our first video in such a way that when someone comes to watch a video on our channel, when they play any video, the first thing they see is that your channel has zero subscribers. In this case, there's a high chance that users will close your video within the first 10-15 seconds. Or, if you watch this video completely, you can win a prize of Path Rupees (likely a monetary prize).  And for our first 100 subscribers, we have a surprise plan, which you'll see in the middle of the video. After that, share the video link on your social media like Facebook, Instagram, and WhatsApp. After doing all this, getting 400-500 views isn't a very difficult task. And friends, now let's talk about that secret I mentioned in the intro, which is YouTube Short Reactions. Making a YouTube reaction video takes a maximum of 10-15 minutes. And if even one out of ten to twelve videos gets 10-12 thousand views, your 100 subscribers will be complete in one day. Once the channel grows, you can delete the Shorts if you want.
