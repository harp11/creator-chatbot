Friends, VidIQ is an app that manages your channel like a personal manager.  It researches and daily shares topics relevant to your channel that have a high chance of going viral.  Not only that, friends, in this app, you just need to write the video title, and the app will provide you with full content research on that topic, including the title, tags, description, thumbnail, and even the video script.  First, download VidIQ from the Play Store or App Store. Then, as soon as you open it, you'll be asked to log in. VidIQ will deeply study your channel to give you better suggestions on what you're doing wrong and what improvements you need to make. Don't be scared to see this; just tap "No Thanks." Now, after doing all this, as soon as the VidIQ homepage opens, your latest uploaded video will be shown at the top. After that, all the videos you've recently uploaded to your channel will appear.  When you tap on a video, its mistakes will start appearing, showing what improvements you can make. If I like something, I'll simply tap on it and tap "Publish Changes to This Video," after which my title will go live on YouTube. Then, after tapping on "Details," I'll get the video details, and finally, recommended keywords will be shown, which you can replace in your video.  After going to "Studio," you'll see a full report of your video's studio performance. The score shown here is zero. Finally, there's a checklist where VidIQ provides a full report of what you should and shouldn't do. After all this, when you tap "Generate," you'll get batch titles, thumbnails, and hooks along with the video script for that idea. You can also go to the keyword tool and search for any particular keyword.
