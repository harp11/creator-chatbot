There's a really cool new YouTube update for all YouTubers! YouTube has launched a feature that makes sharing your YouTube channel much easier.  This means you can skip the step where people are asked to log in using their account – without having to tell them your channel name.  They don't need to subscribe or log in to their account. Let me show you practically how this update works. I opened Google Lens and scanned this QR code.  Immediately after scanning, my YouTube channel opened. I've explained how you can also get a QR code for your channel from YouTube in the last 30 seconds. So keep watching!

First, let's talk about why we need a QR code when we already have our channel name and link. Second, it's sometimes difficult to write it down, but a QR code is something you can share easily; anyone can access your YouTube channel by simply scanning it.

If someone has doubts, they can scan the QR code, go to your channel, and clear their doubts. You can also put your QR code on your personal belongings.  Most importantly, if you participate in any exhibition, attend any event, or have a car, bike, or any public transport, put your YouTube channel's QR code on it. Let's scan it and see – as soon as it's scanned, you'll go directly to the YouTube channel.

There are many more ways. First, you have to go to the YouTube app. After going there, you have to touch the profile, then tap on "View Channel." After tapping this, you will reach your channel. After that, simply tap on the three dots...
