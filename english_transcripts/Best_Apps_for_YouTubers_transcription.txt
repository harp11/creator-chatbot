You won't believe it, just write this much in this tool: what kind of video keyword do you want to make, like YouTube tips, online earning, or finance?  Friends, just as you can't fight a war without weapons, similarly, it's not possible to work on YouTube without proper tools.  Write the title, and what you can use is the Video IQ content generator.  Whatever kind of video you want to make, whatever kind of content research you want to do, if you don't like the title or content, you can reset and retry. You will get new content ideas and new titles. Now that we have a video idea, what's left? But if you download the Open Camera app on your phone, you will get to see all the DSLR settings even inside a normal phone, like ISO, Shutter Speed, and more. If you want to edit your videos for free, you can use VN Video Editor, which is 100% free, and you can do any level of video editing here. You just have to practice. In both these apps, you can do basic to advanced level editing.  Also, to create thumbnails, you can use the Canva app, on which a very detailed dedicated episode is coming soon. Now what's left is just uploading the video, for which you need YT Studio. Just open it, just click here, then you can start uploading the video. And the amazing thing is, this app... Now, because you are watching my official show, it's my duty to tell you something good. So, if you personally ask me in my day-to-day life what I use, there's a mobile application of ChatGPT, you can use that too. But nowadays, I'm starting to like Google Bard even more than ChatGPT.
