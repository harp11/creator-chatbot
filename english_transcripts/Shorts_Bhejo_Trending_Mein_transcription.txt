Friends, we get a feature on Instagram that we don't see on YouTube, which makes your Reels go viral. That is the trending audio, the trending music. Now, where will we find Trending Audio for our YouTube Shorts? How can we create Trending Shorts? And how can a normal creator's video also get on the Trending page? Today, we're going to talk about all this. Hello Guys, Welcome to Seekho Official Show, YouTube Secrets. Now, Let's Begin. So you can see here, on my mobile screen, first I open YouTube. After opening, I'll first see where I'll find the Trending Audio option. So look, as you slide down here, after touching here, you'll think, yes, if I need trending music, I'll simply go to music and start using whatever audio is here. But we shouldn't do that. What should we do? Simply, we have to slide to Shorts. After that, there's another song here on which 177 shorts have been made, below that 8.6K shorts have been made, and from here you should get an idea of what's currently trending on YouTube. And if you make back-to-back Reels on this, there's a higher chance that your Reel will go viral. But if you want to take advantage of this feature, what will you have to do? There, separately, all the shorts that have been made will be shown, but first, those with the most views will be shown, like 5.1 million, 1.3 million, 1 million. So what will you have to do? But here we've seen something good, that what we got on Instagram, trending audio, is now also available on YouTube, which you, I, and we all can take advantage of.
