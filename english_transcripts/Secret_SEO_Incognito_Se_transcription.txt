Friends, if you want to make the best YouTube video on any keyword, incognito mode can help you a lot.  This is the fastest way to search for the best title and content – the ones that are ranking at the top. And I'm saying with guarantee that this method is 100% working and you should definitely follow it. And yes, in less than 30 seconds, I've also taught you all how to go live in incognito. So don't miss that.

Personalization means that if you've subscribed to Technical Guruji's channel and I've subscribed to TechBurner, then for the same keyword, there's a very high chance that you'll be shown Technical Guruji's video and I'll be shown TechBurner's.  If you find keywords with your personalized YouTube search, you'll never be able to properly select keywords and content. Therefore, you need to do something so that YouTube shows you the results as if you are not signed in. Now our phone will act as if we haven't logged in, and it will show the same search results that are shown to an unknown audience.

Friends, now comes the most important step. In Step 2, on the topic you want to make a video on, just search that topic on RapidTables. And all the tags you see here, one by one, search them on YouTube and see which videos are good and which are bad.

Step 4:  From the list you've made, follow the good things in those top videos in your own video. But whatever mistakes you found – because you beat all the videos that were at the top for a particular keyword – because you followed all the good things and avoided all the mistakes in those videos.
