A video that reached 1.4 billion views in 24 hours, but still didn't break the world record. Yes, you heard that right.  Even though it had more views than Dynamite's 101 million views, it didn't set a world record. So, who made that video? We will solve this mystery in this video's intro. Welcome to Seekho Official Show YouTube Secrets, Let's Dive In. First, let's talk about the videos that got the maximum views on YouTube in 24 hours.  And in under 24 hours, it achieved 101.1 million views. This is officially mentioned in the Guinness World Record.  The trailer for "Secret Agent Theft Auto 6" was uploaded on December 5th, 2023. Now you might be thinking, if it's so difficult for even big and popular videos to reach 100 million views, how did a video get 1.4 billion views in 24 hours? That's almost 14 times more! You understand, right? This YouTube channel took advantage of this. But there's another twist here. If a video has 1.4 billion views, it doesn't mean 1.4 billion people actually watched it.  Those who are watching your video, their intent should be to genuinely watch your video. They announced an airdrop event promising various gifts to people. As soon as people clicked the airdrop link, a YouTube video started autoplaying. And the result?  In 24 hours, this video got 1.4 billion views on YouTube. But when YouTube found out that these views came from embedded videos, the record remained incomplete. What should we learn from this whole story? We should learn that if you are sharing your content anywhere, whether it's Discord or any other platform, or embedding it, never compromise your content in the cycle of quick gains. Doing so will ruin your organic growth. And how did you like today's content? Please tell me in the feedback. Thanks for watching.
