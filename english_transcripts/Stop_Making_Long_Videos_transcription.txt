After watching this episode, you'll all say the same thing: "STOP MAKING LONG VIDEOS!" But why? You'll find out in a little while. But if you are a YouTube video creator, or want to be one, then I'll show you something.  I'll show you step by step. Now look here. This video I uploaded two weeks ago has almost 3K views. I'm opening the YouTube app in front of you all. Now look here, what's the first thing I see? Shorts videos, and not just one, but four at a time. And after two long videos, you're shown four short videos. Then if you scroll further, you'll see again, after two or three videos, four short videos are shown. Shorts videos mean long videos are, in a way, hidden among the short videos. And that was fine until... my mind was blown when I went to the trending page.  80% of the channels that are creators, creators on the rise, are short video channels.  And this is the reason why YouTube short video creators are getting 3-4 million subscribers in 2-3 months. The answer is YouTube's algorithm. Currently, YouTube's algorithm is boosting short videos more than long videos. And if you're also a YouTube video creator... we'll meet again tomorrow in the next episode. Until then, keep watching and keep learning.
