Friend, if you even give someone money, you can't use Bollywood songs and music in your YouTube videos.  Not without facing copyright claims and strikes. So definitely watch today's episode, because today I'm going to tell you about not one, not two, but three different platforms. I'll confirm one thing first: in this video, I've explained both paid and free methods.  Whoever likes which method can use it. The first method is a paid website. This is a website where you get to see 20,000+ Indian music tracks, both with and without vocals. In fact, the music I used at the beginning of today's episode... you can also use Invertor or Epidemic. Now let's talk about the 100% free method. The first method is Pixabay. Yes, the same Pixabay from where you download copyright-free videos and photos. Just open the website, tap on the search bar, and type "Bollywood." After searching, apply the "Music" filter, and you'll get hundreds of songs, which will be purely Indian beats. Now let's talk about today's third and my favorite method. After three strikes, your channel can also be deleted. But if you carefully understand what I'm saying, you won't have any problems. You have to search directly on YouTube: "Breaking Copyright Royalty Free Music." From this website, you will be able to download music for your videos using the copied link and use it freely in your YouTube videos without facing any copyright strikes. But wait, wait, wait... there's a small twist here. To give credit, just add the channel name, song name, and song link to your video description, along with a small thank you note.
