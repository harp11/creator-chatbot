Friends, I just uploaded a video to my YouTube channel, and here you see, in YT Studio, the titles of all the videos are appearing, but one video's title is not appearing. So first, let's understand what I did. Just imagine, I texted my friend here, writing "Hello" and I'm texting this on WhatsApp. And as soon as I send it, you'll see that the stars (*) I wrote are not appearing here. Now these stars have become invisible. Let's learn how. First, what you will do is, you will go to google.com. And after coming here, you will search "empty text" then "text". You will search this here. The first website that appears, you will simply touch "Copy to Clipboard". You will simply copy this. After copying, we do this, copy and we do done. And we go back to our YT Studio. And after going to YT Studio, your title, for example, let me show you with another video. Like, here I have, see, the save button is here. Now, as soon as you save, your video will be uploaded to YouTube without a title.
