Everyone says that if you want your YouTube videos to go viral, you need a good hook. The better the hook, the higher your video retention rate will be, and people will watch your video more.  A fish comes to eat the bait, but then gets caught on the hook. Similarly, we need to give a hook in the first 10-15 seconds of our video.  We need to tell viewers something that will make them watch the entire video.  And this hook must be solid. There's a whole psychology behind it, which we'll understand in the next few minutes.  See, hooks and intros are two different things. If you make a ten-minute video, your hook will be approximately one minute long.  No matter how long your video is, the first one to two minutes are crucial.

Hello friends, I'm Havasng Seekho. Welcome to the Official Show YouTube Secrets. Let's learn something new today.  As you can see on my phone, I have a notepad here with five different scripts written. If I tap on "Free Transition Pack for YT," you'll see... My first line is:  Nowadays, you find inbuilt transitions in every video editor.  So our first line will target a wide audience – we'll try to target as many people as possible. And this point will relate to almost every video editor. Now, whether someone is searching for transitions or not, I've created a problem in the mind of an editor, in the mind of a creator, that a video's hook, intro, and outro are all separate things.  So, if I talk about… I made a series called "Intro and Outro Secrets." If I tap on it, you'll see…  It's something to think about, right? Every creator who doesn't know this will be confused. What is it about intros that takes two to three hours just to plan them? Similarly, you need to plan your content in the same way, so that even if someone just taps on your video, after hearing the first line, they'll watch your entire video.
