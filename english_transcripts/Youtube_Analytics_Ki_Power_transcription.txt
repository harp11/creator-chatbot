Just as every student who passes any exam has all the exam books, every successful YouTuber has the YT Studio mobile application on their phone. But new YouTubers don't understand this at all.  It's completely wrong. Let me tell you, you can make great videos, but until you understand this app properly, you won't be able to become a successful YouTuber.  You have to pass physicals and medicals in other fields, but for YouTube, where you can earn not just fifty thousand, but lakhs and crores of rupees a month, nobody studies.  You can earn lakhs of rupees.
