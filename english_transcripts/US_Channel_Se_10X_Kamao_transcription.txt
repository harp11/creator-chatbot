You all know the huge difference in earnings between India and the USA.  In India, 10,000 views generate 800 rupees, while in the USA, 10,000 views generate 16,000 rupees.  And yes, in the last two points, I explained about the top 3 niches where earnings are higher than finance. I also showed how you can get US traffic even with zero subscribers.

Now, since we live in India, if I search for any topic on YouTube to find out what content is most viewed in the USA, I simply go to ChatGPT and give it this command. In a few seconds, a complete list of YouTube channels will appear that are most viewed in the USA in that particular category.

After finding this, we need to go to those YouTube channels.  For example, if a camel lecture is discussed and explained, we need to copy the link of that video and go to NoteGPT. NoteGPT is a free AI website. Now, give this command.  You will get 100% copyright-free content that is trending and popular in the USA. Because you've converted a long video into a short form, and if you don't want to spend money, you can do the voiceover yourself, read the script, and then do video editing.

Now that your content research is done, you have the script, and the voiceover is also done, what's the next step? You have a ready-made video that you upload to YouTube.  Because YouTube doesn't show Indian content to US audiences, we need to pay attention to only two settings. The first is how it appears when you upload the video. Let's assume you have a fresh YouTube channel with zero subscribers or an old one where you want to bring in US traffic. If you are using English, the closer your accent is to a US accent, the more your content will be shown.  The initial 1000-2000 subscribers need to be generated through shorts. This content is 30-50 minutes long, and those who watch it watch it completely. Your single video gets 4-5 ads, so your earnings are quite high.
