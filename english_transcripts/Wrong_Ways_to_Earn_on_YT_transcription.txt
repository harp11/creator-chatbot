A girl who earned only eighty thousand rupees per month a year ago from a YouTube channel, what did she do in one year that her monthly income became eleven lakhs rupees? And if you go to her YouTube channel, you will see that she has uploaded only three videos. If you go to the videos, you will see that one video was uploaded thirteen years ago. How can we earn money? What things should we pay attention to? We are going to talk about all this in detail in today's episode.  Hello friends, I am Hawasing, welcome to all of you in Seekho Official Show YouTube Secrets. Let's understand this practically. I am going to tell you 3-4 different examples, and the last one is my favorite, which you should know because there you will see…  METHOD NO. 1 If I search on YouTube "Bollywood Full Movies", you will see that I have a DRJ RECORDS movie. This is an official YouTube channel. But if I come down a little, how can this be done? Why are they getting strikes, and can they earn money? Well, the answer is that these YouTube channels are never monetized. If you upload content with Indian IP addresses, then after a copyright claim, your video will be taken down.  They upload copyrighted content. By the time YouTube detects it, millions of views have already come on your videos. And when those views come, subscribers will also come to your channel. The same thing is done on these YouTube channels. If three strikes come, the channel can be deleted. But even if two strikes come, the YouTube channel will not be deleted. This YouTube channel will remain safe. But yes, there was a method that I shared with all of you. Method No. 2 CPM Work Now what is this? This is that in the way you get $2, $3, $5, $10 per 1000 views. If you run those views targeting a specific country, okay?  The earnings on their YouTube channel were 30,000-40,000, but someone without telling them did CPM work on their YouTube channel, due to which their earnings for one day became 11 lakh rupees. Because if this thing is caught, your YouTube channel will be immediately demonetized. But the point to understand here is that by using CPM work, you can increase the earnings on your YouTube channel.  Nowadays, many such applications are running on YouTube that tell users that if you invest 100 rupees here, your money will multiply in 23 days. It can be 1.5X, meaning it can become 150 rupees. Here, overnight, thousands of people, lakhs of people who don't have much money, their money is taken away. Now why am I telling you this? Because I also get… and this thing is being done by many people on YouTube. By promoting fake applications and fake websites, they are earning a lot of money. And remember, genuine applications never give so much money blindly. So these were the three most popular methods used…  Even after understanding all these things, if you have any doubts in your mind, you can tell me, I will try my best to make an episode on it. Thanks for watching.
