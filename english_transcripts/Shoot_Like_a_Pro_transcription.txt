Even if you do excellent Content Research, Scripting, and SEO, if your video production isn't good, your channel's chances of growing fall below 70%. Production refers to the video shooting process. This episode isn't for all YouTubers, because today we'll learn three tips to shoot like a pro. Hello guys, welcome to Seek Official Show, YouTube Secrets. Now, let's begin. Because even in DSLRs and smartphones, the camera lens needs proper light to record the frame correctly. If you provide good lighting, the video will be crisp, clearer, and sharper.  And you should also have a light above your head to avoid shadows. Second, composition: The video frame should be such that the viewer's focus remains on you. When you set up the camera, carefully ensure that the phone's camera is at a 90-degree angle to the ground level.  This means that the height of your mobile or DSLR camera should be the same as the height of your eyes. And lastly, you need to include the subject's left, right, top, and bottom within the frame. Or, if you want moving shots, you can use a gimbal. Now, these are the main points, but I have some bonus tips for you. First, having a good camera is not enough. Second, good storytelling doesn't make a pro shoot; before shooting any video, you need to practice for the shoot.
