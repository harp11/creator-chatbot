Friends, many people use TubeBuddy or WeedIQ to create successful YouTube videos. However, their premium plans are very expensive.  YouTube has a Keyword Research Tool; we'll discuss it in detail in this video/episode. This Keyword Research Tool will show you videos that are more likely to go viral. Hello Guys, Welcome back to Seekh Official Show, YouTube Secrets. Now, Let's Begin.  After clicking here, you'll see "Explore Topics". Let's say you have a new video idea, a particular topic you want to make a video on. You can search there. For example, I'll search "YouTube Tips". If I make a video on this, my video has a higher chance of performing well.  If you click this arrow, look here â€“ wow, "how to make a youtube channel," "youtube channel tips for beginners." So, if YouTube itself is suggesting what videos to make, why use any premium tool? You won't make all the videos at once.  Friends, when you search a particular keyword here, look below. YouTube provides a separate section here. This tool is not just simple; it has advanced features too. Let's say you don't have a keyword, you're confused about what video to make. What will you do? Simply come to the Keyword Research Tool and look here at "Top searches". Friends, what do you think of YouTube's keyword research tool? Please tell me in the feedback. Your feedback motivates me to create better content.
