Friends, today I'm going to tell you five mistakes. If you make even one of them, your YouTube channel can be deleted anytime, whether you have one subscriber, a hundred subscribers, or a million subscribers.  And hello guys, back to Seek Official Show YouTube Secrets. Now let's begin. Mistake number one: You must have seen many short channels that start a video, tell you a little, and then say... Mistake No. 2:  Something is currently trending. Many YouTubers upload content from someone else onto their YouTube channels, with their own voice. For example, they upload a five-minute arts and crafts video. So why would someone give you permission to use their video? Mistake number three: Now, something is trending on YouTube: no face, no voice. No face, no voice. No face shown, no voice shown.  It's a 40-50 second video. Then they take a non-copyright music track, which is 10-15 minutes long, and sync the two to make a video.  There's no creativity in that. If you upload this kind of video long-term, there's a rule that you can't manipulate the stock market through your YouTube channel. And those who were doing this, even very large channels, YouTube completely banned those channels from the stock market. But there are two or three things to understand here that you should know. If you make videos about the stock market, you can't tell anyone to buy a particular stock. You can't make predictions about what's going to happen, and you can't suggest to someone, "I like this, you should buy it too." And as everyone started buying, the stock price would suddenly shoot up. They would sell their own stock and exit the market.  Meaning, other people thought they were making a profit, but only *they* profited. If you show any illegal activity on YouTube – whether you're showing how to download a modded application, crack software, or bypass any security – then... friends, these were five rules you should know. And if you liked any of these rules or learned something new...
