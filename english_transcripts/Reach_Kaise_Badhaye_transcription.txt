Whether you have a new YouTube channel or an old one, you must know about YouTube reach. YouTube reach means how many people YouTube is reaching your YouTube channel. So, whether your YouTube channel is new or old, you must first target YT search, YouTube search.  If you target YouTube search, I have four videos; one has very few videos, another has around 200-300 videos, and the other two also have a similar number of videos. But there's one video where I have more than 5000 views. It got more touch, meaning its CTR and watch time were both good. After that, YouTube started suggesting this video.  This means once you reach new people, and if new people like you, what will happen when you create such content? As you publish a video, all your subscribers who watch you will touch your video. But just think here, if you made a video that your subscribers didn't like, what will happen? Something that hardly anyone is searching for, some content that very few people watch. So you should always create content that has a broad audience, millions of viewers. Now, how will you find these topics? Watch videos on YouTube with at least one million views, or any topic where all the videos being made are going viral.  This point I've told you needs to be included in your content research.  Most importantly, which I keep telling you in almost every episode, CTR and watch time. I won't spend much time here. Now think, if you upload one video today, one video after a month, and then upload one video per day for 10-15 days after a month, people won't come to watch you themselves. But when you are consistent, once someone sees your video, sees it again, and sees it a third time, they realize that this creator brings new knowledge every time, consistently makes videos, so your chances of increasing views become much higher. So guys, these were five different tips by following which you can increase your impressions.
