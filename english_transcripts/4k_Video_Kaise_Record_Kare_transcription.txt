Friends, do your YouTube video qualities also look amazing before uploading, but the quality goes down after uploading? If you bought your phone 2-3 years ago and your phone cost more than â‚¹10,000, then 99.9% of your phones will have a 4K video recording option. However, these options lack professional tools. So you will have to download a professional camera app from the Play Store. This free camera app provides the option to customize every setting like a DSLR. Just doing this won't be enough, my friend. Now, let's come to the most important steps that are most crucial to do. You will have to enable "Digital Video Stabilization". This ensures your videos are recorded stably, whether your phone has OIS support or not. YouTube's official blog clearly states that if you create a 4K video at 25 FPS, it should be 40 Mbps, and if you create it at 60 FPS, it should be around 80 Mbps. Therefore, we are going to choose 40 Mbps here. But now, let's talk about what to do if your phone doesn't even have a 4K option. In this case, recording a 4K video isn't possible. By doing this, YouTube won't know if your video is Full HD or 4K. But because the video format is 4K, it will treat that video as 4K.
