Friend, you work day and night, making YouTube videos, trying your best to improve.  These tools are usually shown to you only once a week.  It might be that when you're watching this episode, this tool isn't visible on your mobile. So first, you have to go to YT Studio and then touch Analytics. After doing this, touch the slider in the Main Overview tab that says "Your Last Weekly Recap is Here."

The next slide shows you how many new viewers came to your YouTube channel last week and subscribed. This is very important.  If you look closely, only 164 people subscribed to me.  YouTube gave me the opportunity to get 35,000 people to subscribe to my channel, but I only impressed 164.

The next slide shows you the top 3 keywords that performed best on your channel last week.  This should give you an idea. Note them down and try to make videos on these keywords or similar ones, because that's what people want from you.

This is to check how well you know your channel. Like in my case, I'm being asked how many shares my videos got last week.
