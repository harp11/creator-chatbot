Friends, if you also want to earn money from YouTube by creating YouTube Shorts but you can't wait too long and you are looking for some ideas on which if you make Shorts, your instant earnings will start instantly. Hello guys, I am Hawasing and welcome to Seekho Official Show, YouTube Secrets. Now let's begin.  Once you see this YouTube channel, you'll see what they are doing on their YouTube channel.  Whatever phone they are making this video on, the company that makes this product, they have sent them all these things for free, and along with that, they have also given them money, saying, "Sir, make a video about us on your YouTube channel." But that's not what I want to tell you. Rather, the point is that they earn a lot more money than all these things, which is affiliate marketing.  Whatever product they are making a video about, it has their affiliate link, and the meaning of their affiliate link is that if any user, after watching their video, buys any product through their link, they get a direct commission, which is between the 27th and 28th of every month. They start uploading their videos creatively. You don't have a product, don't worry. Watch this one video of mine where I earned money from Amazon and Flipkart. My YouTube channel wasn't monetized, meaning I only earned money from affiliate marketing at that time, which you can also earn. So today's idea number one is this, whether your YouTube channel is monetized or not. Now friends, let's talk about today's second YouTube channel idea, through which 90% of you can earn money if you want to. Whatever you know, start making videos about it, and also start giving your mobile number in every video. Even if you don't know much, you must know video editing if you want to be a content creator. You can start online earning by providing editing services. You will have to create a Shorts YouTube channel, and you can make Sigma Shorts here, which are going viral on YouTube right now, at the time I'm making this video. Or someone has given a funny reply. That is, a sharp answer should be given within that reply. If you make this type of video and add good visuals and good SFX, and I have integrated this third idea because if you make Sigma videos on your YouTube channel, your videos will grow fastest at this time.
