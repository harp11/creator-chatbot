Want to create YouTube videos without editing or hard work? Let's get started. Before starting today's episode, I want to warn you that it's crucial to understand every piece of information in this video. If you miss any information, your channel won't grow. You've probably seen many videos on YouTube where one, two, or three people just sit in front of the camera reacting.  This type of video is called a reaction video, and you can build an entire YouTube channel around it. Here are some popular reaction channels you can get ideas from. To make a reaction video, download the XRecorder app from the Play Store. Start screen recording with fast cam. Then, open the YouTube app on your phone.  How do you like the video? After recording the video, just trim the unwanted parts and upload it to YouTube.  And there you have it, your reaction video is ready. But, but, but... now comes the important part. If you create a reaction channel where your video takes up 70% of the screen and the video you're reacting to takes up only 30%, and instead of watching the entire video at once, you pause it frequently... your video needs creativity and value.  It shouldn't negatively impact the original video's image, market value, or earnings. To understand these nuances better, you can watch my other episode on this topic. Thanks for watching.
