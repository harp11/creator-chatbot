Friends, only those who have experienced their first YouTube income know the excitement of it. For those who haven't yet, that first YouTube earning feels like a dream.

First, let's talk about how much my first YouTube income was and how long it took. So friends, this story begins in December 2015, when I created the YouTube channel I still work on today.  I made back-to-back videos for quite some time, but the videos didn't go viral at all. Then I realized that I needed to convert my channel to a particular niche. So, only in 2018 did I start working in a particular niche on my YouTube channel.  After that, let's talk about the difficulties I faced.  Friends, the difficulty was that my AdSense account reached the minimum threshold, meaning the amount YouTube sends payments for. Then, when I inquired with my bank, even the bank manager of the SBI branch in my area had no knowledge of this code. For about 7-8 days, I was busy finding this code.

Now, in 2018, finding a bank's SWIFT code was very difficult. But today, all this has become very easy. Now, let's talk about the important point that I mentioned in the intro.
