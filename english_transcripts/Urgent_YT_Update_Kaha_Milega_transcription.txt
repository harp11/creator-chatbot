Friends, just as you can't crack any exam without knowing the syllabus, similarly, if you want to earn money from YouTube, you absolutely must know about YouTube updates. Whether you have few subscribers or many, whether you get views or not, you must know about every YouTube update first. Otherwise, you might face problems anytime. And yes, friends, lastly, we discussed how to find platforms where you can see not only the latest, but also updates from one minute ago, two minutes ago, or even a year ago. Simply search for "Creator Insider" on YouTube.  You'll find this YouTube channel with currently 732,000 subscribers. It's very important for creators to know this. But here, you might face a problem: these videos are in English, so you might not understand them. So, what we'll do is simply play the video; subtitles will start appearing at the bottom. But these are in English, and we don't know English, so what will we do? Again, tap on settings, then tap on captions.

Today's second platform is X (formerly Twitter). When you open X, search for "YouTube Creators." Simply tap the search button, then the search bar.  After that, you'll get this page, which currently has 6.5 million followers. You'll see a post from half an hour ago and another from ten hours ago.

Now, let's talk about today's most important method, where you'll find not only the latest but also updates from six minutes ago, a year ago, etc. Here, all the latest YouTube updates will appear. And if you scroll down, you'll see all the new updates. If you scroll further down, you'll find updates month by month â€“ October 2024, September 2024, and even older updates. That is, you can check updates from a year ago here.
