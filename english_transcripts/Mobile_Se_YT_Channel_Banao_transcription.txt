Friends, if you also want to create a professional YouTube channel from your phone and start earning money from it, but you don't know how professionals create them, how to create banners, what the channel name should be, then I'm going to tell you all those things step-by-step, keeping which in mind you can create a professional YouTube channel and start working on it within just 10-12 minutes. If your YouTube channel is not growing, then after watching today's video completely, you will understand what mistake you have made on that channel and what mistakes you should not make while creating a new channel.  See, first of all, we need to create a professional new Gmail account in our phone through which we are going to create our YouTube channel. We don't have to use our existing one. We have to tap on the profile, then tap on "Add another account," and then tap on "Add another account" here. When you tap here, different options will be shown: for personal use, for work, and for business. People think that YouTube is my business, my work, so I should tap on the second one. And then, you have to create it in the same way as a normal Gmail account is created. And when you create a new Gmail account, simply log in to it. To avoid this, what can you do? Here, first of all, tap on the profile, then tap on "Manage Your Google Account," and after tapping here, you have to go to the fourth option, which is Security. After this, you have to come down a little; there's Two-Step Verification. After that, Authenticator, Google Prompt, Two-Step Phone Verification, Recovery Phone, Recovery Email – you have to enable all these. Before creating the channel, we should have a name for our channel, and deciding what kind of channel name it should be is very important. I will elaborate on this in the video; otherwise, the video will become unnecessarily long. In it, you will learn how to professionally create a channel logo and banner. The videos I have mentioned, you can simply search for them on YouTube. And after doing this much, search for studio.youtube.com. When you search this link, all the features will appear in front of you, just like they appear on a computer. That is, we will do all the work inside the mobile phone, but in my case, I already have a YouTube channel here, but we need to create a new YouTube channel here. For this, you have to simply zoom in, tap on the profile at the top, where we haven't created any YouTube channel yet. Now you will see, I have "Create a channel." And after that, the name is being asked. For now, I'm creating a channel named "Hawasing Tanwari." Creating a channel is not a difficult task; the difficult task is the preparation before creating a channel. Now let's talk about some advanced features that you should unlock first after creating the channel. Along with this, you should add your YouTube channel keywords here. Keywords mean, just like you add tags to a video, your YouTube channel should also have tags. If I have named it "Hawasing," their YouTube channel comes up in search rankings quite quickly. People who say that our YouTube channel is not ranking, not coming up, not appearing in search – and remember, doing this is very important; otherwise, likes on your videos may be stopped, comments may be stopped, and limited monetization may be applied. After this, your earnings can also be reduced, so setting this up is very important. Like you can add thumbnails, post more videos, and also some additional tools will be provided. I am telling you the fastest method. Do video verification here, in which a simple mail will come to your Gmail, and you will just have to move your neck and record a short video; by doing this, your account will be instantly verified. As soon as you do this, your professional YouTube channel will be ready, and yes, now you are ready to upload content. And watch my YouTube secrets videos to quickly create your professional YouTube channel, and if you have any problem, tell me in the feedback so that I can cover them in the next episodes.
