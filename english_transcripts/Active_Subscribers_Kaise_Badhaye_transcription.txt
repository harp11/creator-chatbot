Friends, on YouTube, active subscribers are those who watch your videos as soon as you upload them.  They may watch through notifications, or by searching for your videos.  Some YouTube channels have few subscribers, yet get many views on each video. I'll tell you about some mistakes I made that you should avoid. I'll explain them, but today I'll share three different methods. First, let's talk about my YouTube channel, which has 270,000 subscribers.  When I upload a video, some get 20,000 views, others 50,000. They comment, you reply, and answer their doubts. If it's an entertainment channel, people want to interact. They want to ask questions. Whether you go live once a month, twice a month, or daily, you should go live on your YouTube channel. You can benefit from this method, connect with your audience, and build active subscribers.

Method No. 2: Trending Content.  Sometimes we make videos our subscribers don't like. If we keep making such videos, our active subscribers will leave. We should only create content our audience wants to see, or what's trending.  Creating more trending content will attract viewers beyond your existing subscribers, directly doubling your growth.

Method No. 3: Create Engagement Now & New. There's a great YouTube channel where they almost always say: if you want videos on this topic, to increase likes, shares, comments, and subscribers.

And friends, finally, my favorite method and my biggest mistake! I only realized this recently, but I wish I'd known this 4 or 5 years ago.  Like Durr Rauti, create public videos that resonate with everyone.  Beyond the technical aspects, you need to create an emotional bond with your audience.
