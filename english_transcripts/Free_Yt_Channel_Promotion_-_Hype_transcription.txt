YouTube Hype is a feature that YouTube is going to launch in 2025 for small creators.  After this, creators will be able to promote their YouTube channels for free. This also reveals that YouTube considers all channels with less than 5,000 subscribers to be small. How many subscribers do you have?  Please let me know in the feedback.

First, let's discuss what this feature is and how it works.  It's a feature that won't be given to you, but to your subscribers. Your subscribers will help you promote your channel for free. Each subscriber will be given weekly Hype points.  When your subscribers Hype your videos, their Hype points will decrease, while you will receive Hype points for your video.  Videos with the most Hype points in a week (top 100) will be shown in the YouTube Hype tab. YouTube will promote these videos (and the channels) as good content worth watching, doing so for free.

Let's understand this in detail.  Each of your subscribers will get three chances per week to Hype a creator. But if all three Hype points are used up, that's it.  It's an amazing feature, a bit complicated, but I've tried my best to explain it clearly. If you didn't understand, you can replay the video. Now, let's understand when and how we will get this feature. It's currently being tested in Turkey and Taiwan. Once it's rolled out worldwide, it will be activated on all your channels one by one.
