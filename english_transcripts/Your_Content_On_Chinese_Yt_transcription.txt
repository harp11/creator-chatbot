Think friends, the effort is yours, the content is yours, but how would it feel if someone else reaps the rewards?  A lot of this is happening on this website, Jogi China's second YouTube. Now, three different questions come to mind. First, if they use our videos, can we not strike them? Second, if we want, can we download Chinese videos from this website and upload them to YouTube before this episode finishes? We will get answers to all three questions with full information. To join the family, welcome to learn official show YouTube secrets. So can we strike them? The one-word answer is no. Because within China, YouTube,  Vimeo, Facebook, Instagram, and even all of India's social media platforms are banned. And that's why they have created their own video platforms, social media platforms, and other apps, which have nothing to do with the rest of the world. Therefore, if any Chinese user uses your content... can we download content from this website and upload it to YouTube to make money? Well, the one-word answer is yes. Absolutely you can, and on this topic you will say that on YouTube, whoever uploads the content first is the actual owner. Therefore, if you download any content from China's YouTube and upload it to YouTube, and you are the first user to upload it, then you will not have any problem. So, ensure that whatever content you are re-uploading, has not been uploaded by someone else before. Otherwise, there may be problems with monetization. 3rd Question: What is the name of the website? And how can we access Chinese YouTube while living in India? Well, the one-word answer is bilibili.com and you can access this website in India just like www.youtube.com. Meaning, you don't need to use a VPN or do any extra effort. Just search bilibili.com on Google, and then you will be able to easily access Chinese YouTube.
