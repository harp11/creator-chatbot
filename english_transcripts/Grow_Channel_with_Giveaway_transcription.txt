Quickie Twinkle is a YouTube channel that uploads one video per day.  Another YouTube channel is Technical Arif, which uploads two videos per day. If you also want to smartly boost subscribers and views on your YouTube channel, then maybe a giveaway could be a good option for you. You only need to understand three things. First, let's understand what to give away. You need to go to your YouTube channel, go to your videos, and deeply analyze your latest videos. Look at the content of your top 10-20 recently uploaded videos and understand them. Now, if I assume I want to do a giveaway on my channel, what would I do? Looking at my content, I understand that my content is watched by people who want to earn money online. After this decision, the second thing is participation rules, which are very important. Because if you set too many participation rules, no one will participate in your giveaway. And you will pick the winner whose comment is the best.  In this way, people will watch your videos completely, and consequently, the content completely, so audience retention will also be good. This will significantly boost the video. Now let's talk about trust building and most importantly, how to promote it for free.  You just need to make a three-to-four-minute introduction video where you explain all the giveaway conditions. In your upcoming new video, you can put the link to this introduction video in the description. And as you show the winners, you can give a call-out saying that if you also want to participate, check out the link in the description. And if you follow this whole process, then even if you have a budget of 1000-2000 rupees per month, you will see 100% results from doing a giveaway on your channel.
