Friends, whenever you upload a video on YouTube, immediately after uploading, a monetization section appears. When you touch it, you'll have the option to enable ads.  Now, what this is, and what things to keep in mind, is very important for you as a YouTuber to know.  Let's first talk about why the clarification form is given. YouTube says that they cannot monetize every type of video; meaning you can't earn money from every video. You cannot earn the full revenue; you have to share revenue with the actual content creator.  There's a third party where you see a green dollar, meaning that if your video has any of these exceptions, you have to tell YouTube what's in your video and what's not. If you don't tell them, YouTube can take action. If there's sexual activity but it's blurred, you still have to mention it. If you think that because you blurred it, you don't have to mention it, that's wrong.  Then we have violent content. Violence means fights, riots. There are three separate categories here:  First, if you've shown any forceful arrest. YouTube has given many sections, I'll explain it to you very briefly so you know everything in less time. Then there's Harmful Acts and Unreliable Claims. This is very important for you all to understand. If you're showing someone's hand being cut off or their throat being slit in your video, even if it's for acting, it needs to be mentioned. Several sections are given here; you need to understand them, like stunts, content showing physical harm and distress. Next is Recreational Drug Content.  This is very important to understand. Even if you're playing a game like GTA 5 and it shows a drug scene, you need to mention it.  Then there's Embedding Dishonest Behavior, which was recently added. This means, let's say your video has educational content or music-related content, and you've shown dishonest behavior, meaning you haven't shown the correct behavior. Then there's hateful and derogatory content. What kind of content is this? Any content where you've spread hatred against someone, a politician, or another YouTuber. Because if you do any activity on YouTube that's different from others and against YouTube's guidelines, or even if it's for educational purposes but you've created content involving firearms, you have to mention it. Right? Because if you don't, and YouTube catches it, they can take down your video and give your channel a Community Guideline strike. Then we have Sensitive Events. We've already made an episode about this topic. You can search for this topic on the same channel.  In that case too, you might face problems. Then we have Controversial Issues; I've already explained this. And lastly, the most important: inappropriate language used in the video. Three different things are mentioned here. If you don't tick them and YouTube sees it, YouTube will say, "You're fooling us," and they can strike your video. After watching this content, tell me your feedback on what you learned. Thanks for watching.
