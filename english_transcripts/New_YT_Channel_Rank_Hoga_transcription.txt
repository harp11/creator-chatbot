Friends, do you know that if you create a channel by following some tricks, your YouTube channel starts ranking as soon as it's created?  Once, you see this, this is my student's channel which was created just two days ago. And if you go to the YouTube channel, you'll see that not many videos are uploaded here; it's a completely fresh YouTube channel. Still, it's ranking at the top. So, if you are also a YouTube video creator and you also want to rank your YouTube channel like this, watch this video till the end. Now, channel names are of two types. First, you don't keep any kind of name; you keep your own name. For example, my name is Hawasing, so I can keep my YouTube channel name as Hawasing. But here we have to keep one thing in mind: if you want to create a YouTube channel with your name, first search that name on YouTube. For example, if I search here hawasin g, I search my name, but when you search your name, someone else's YouTube channel might come up. And if it doesn't come up, what will you do? After touching the dot shown above, you will touch the search filter here and here in the channel or if there is any such profile which has a lot of subscribers. If someone else has already created a channel on YouTube with your name, and it's also active and has a lot of subscribers. Second, you might not keep your name; like me, you can keep a more professional branding name, like I have kept Comfort Earning. First of all, the YouTube channel you are creating should not already exist on YouTube. And if it exists, it shouldn't be active or it should have very few subscribers. If you name your YouTube channel something like Bhagavad Gita, Quran, Bible, these are words that have already been used in many videos on YouTube. You will have to find a name for your YouTube channel. But nowadays, nobody has that much time, so what will you do? This secret trick, you have to go. Now, from this entire list, you have to pick a name that doesn't already exist on YouTube. That is, you have to search it on YouTube. First, simply go inside your YT Studio in desktop mode, then go to settings, and after going here, tap on the channel written here. And after coming here, the trick is to enter different keywords, then enter fiction funda together, then enter fiction funda Hindi separately, and those similar to your name. And if you keep in mind all these things I have told you, within one to two hours of creating the channel, your YouTube channel will start ranking at the top in the search, and this is the secret text prompt from Chat GPT.
