My latest video features a video that's performing exceptionally well. If I go to the Misho videos, you'll see its retention rate is incredibly high.  Many videos have been uploaded there, but we haven't seen much growth. However, if a new YouTube channel sees growth, why not download all the videos and upload them to a new YouTube channel?  You're not wrong to think that; you can do it, but keeping many things in mind. In today's episode, I'm going to address three of your biggest doubts. And in the last 30 seconds, I'll show you how to upload a single YouTube video to not just two, but three, four, or as many YouTube channels as you want.

Doubt number one: Can we re-upload videos, meaning to a new YouTube channel, without YouTube saying anything?  And that channel might get monetized initially, but after some time, your YouTube channel might get demonetized. But there's a way to bypass this, which I'll discuss later. See, sometimes when you upload a video to YouTube, your content becomes public domain, and anyone can use it. So, technically, we can't upload the same video to two different channels, right?

If I'm using screen recording, I can change the screen recording position, change the background, and slightly alter the overall video length (a second or two). In this case, there's a 99% chance you won't get any kind of strike. But we've already tried this, and many YouTubers upload different variants of the same video.

First, you can't directly re-upload content to another YouTube channel without making any modifications.

Third, if you want to re-upload content—to earn money from the same video two or three times—you'll have to create different variants of it.
