A YouTube tool that tells you what's wrong with your thumbnails and how to improve them.  It also tells you what things to keep in mind, and much more. Which thumbnail is better, A or B? If you answered thumbnail B, you're completely wrong because YouTube considers thumbnail A better. I'll be sharing that in this episode. Everyone's YouTube channel is different. Some thumbnails work well on some channels, while others work well on different channels. Hello Guys, Welcome back to Seekh Official Show YouTube Secrets. Now let's begin. First, open YT Studio and touch Analytics here. Then, in the Oreo tab, you'll have to find this tab, which may not be visible to you at first. I'll show you how to find it.  As soon as you touch it, this interface will appear. It tells you that thumbnails are powerful, so it's very important to check which of your thumbnails are performing best. And also, because your thumbnails are displayed on PCs, mobiles, and TVs, they should be in the best resolution. In my opinion, your thumbnails should have a resolution of 1920x1080p, which is best for YouTube. This tab will give you an idea of where you can improve. Last and most important, your thumbnails should have their own style. So friends, that was today's episode where we discussed best practices for thumbnails. If you have any doubts, please leave a comment.
