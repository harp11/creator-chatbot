MrBeast records his videos in English, but you can watch and listen to his videos in Hindi, Gujarati, Tamil, or any other language.  In today's special episode, we will discuss the advantages of this new YouTube feature and when and how we can all get it.  And finally, I'll share a secret tip with you. To understand this, think about whether movies released simultaneously wouldn't earn as much money if they weren't available in Hindi â€“ like *Pushpa*, *Kantara*, or *K.G.F*. Similarly, if MrBeast didn't make his videos in Hindi, many people in India wouldn't understand his English videos, and his earnings and viewership from India would decrease. Because of this, YouTube will launch this auto-dubbing feature using AI on its platform in the coming time. However, friends, there will be some difficulties.  This feature is being gradually provided to creators, who can access it in their YT Studio under the Language section. Initially, this feature is being given to monetized educational and documentary channels. Finally, let's talk about today's important tip, which is very important for you all to know. If you create content that can be viewed in India as well as other countries, please give me feedback on how the content was. Thanks for watching.
