I can tell you all in writing that after watching today's video, you'll forget Audacity, Adobe Premiere, and all other editing tools. Whether you use a mic or not, your voice will be very professional, like that of very expensive mics. Let's learn something new today. Whether you're recording audio, recording music, creating podcasts, making YouTube videos, or anything else, you can generate Dolby Atmos sound using this application, with the help of AI. Isn't that amazing? Let's learn how. First, you'll download Dolby Atmos from the Play Store â€“ meaning, you'll download the Dolby On application. After downloading and opening it, the interface will appear.  The first time you log in, you'll need to sign up. Then you'll record the audio. In my case, I always record my audio and video on separate devices. Here, I'm going to record audio. So, we'll simply tap this mic. After starting the recording, whatever you speak will start recording. When you stop it, it will be saved. You see here, the oral output is written above; there's a checkmark. If you turn it off, Dolby will be off, and you'll hear your normal recorded voice. Then, if you tap on Tools, you'll see Style. You can choose the style for your video: Standard, Natural, Warm, Deep.  If you've ever seen a movie trailer, you can achieve that deep voice here. Next, we have the denoise tool. If there's fan noise, AC noise, or other background noise in your voice, this tool helps. Then, we have the Tone tool. You can increase or decrease the treble, mid-tone, or bass in your voice, automatically improving the sound and making it louder. Finally, there's the trimming option, but I wouldn't recommend using it here.  I don't think there's a more advanced or easy-to-use tool than this for your videos. And the best part is, this tool is provided by Atmos itself.
