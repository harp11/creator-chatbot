Friends, if your YouTube channel isn't getting any views, I can tell you in writing that with the help of cross-platform promotion, you can boost your channel very quickly.  And I'll show you everything. If you go to my YouTube channel, you'll see in my latest videos, views aren't that high – like 187, 1200, 330, or 1000. But if you go back a little, you'll see [an extremely long string of zeros representing a very large number – likely intended to represent millions or billions]. I'll show you how to do it step-by-step, but don't skip a single second. Look, this is my latest video where I've shown how you can earn money by playing games. Now, I've created this video, and I know my Instagram gets good views. Now what you can do is, while creating your Instagram Reels, focus on scripting and you can increase your main video's views. Let me tell you how. After that, you'll have to touch edit. After touching edit, you have to write a particular code in the video title, like I'm going to the video title. Now, what will be our second task? We have to make a video on Instagram where we are talking about video editing or whatever our video is related to.  Assuming that if you get one lakh views on Instagram, two lakh views, and if even 10% of that audience searches for that hashtag, then your chances of increasing views become very high. And because I just opened the YouTube app, because I've just added the hashtag, it's possible the video won't show up in the search, but still, we'll try. We'll search for the hashtag, the one we just added. Now, man, I'm very sad that the video on which I had 17 million views… if I integrate code into it and make a dedicated video…
