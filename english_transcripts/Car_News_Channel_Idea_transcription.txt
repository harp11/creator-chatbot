Friends, you don't need any investment or professional camera.  You just need a decent mobile phone, some video editing skills, and a little content research. In this episode, we're going to completely decode the car review YouTube channel.  What is the growth potential of this type of YouTube channel? How much can you earn? Will a YouTube channel like this grow if you start one today? Look, I'll show you a YouTube channel called PowerDrift. When you search it, you'll see they have 2.82 million subscribers. Now, look, compared to the number of subscribers, their views aren't that high. I'm talking about all of them, but that's not the case, and that's a good thing. If you look at their older videos – three days ago, 24,000 views, 265,000, 233,000, and also 503,000 views on their older videos, which were recently uploaded. Keep playing the video, and what's written there?  Includes paid promotion. This video was made on a Tata Tigor and a Tiago. Even big market leaders are getting 10,000 to 15,000 rupees for making a single video. So you too can start earning money in this industry. Along with this, they make many videos discussing car gadgets – inflators, vacuum cleaners, or any kind of perfume.  Here, I want to show you a YouTube channel that started with no car and no money.  They built their car channel and are earning good money today. They're taking photos from a single spot and reviewing cars. They're reviewing cars. And they didn't make one or two such videos; they made these videos for a long time.  In the beginning, this is perfectly fine. When you gain enough experience and feel you have proper knowledge, then you can start copying.
