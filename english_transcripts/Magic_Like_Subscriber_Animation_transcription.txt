If someone says "like" in a YouTube video, this animation appears on the like button for the viewer, and if someone says "subscribe," this animation appears, which is known on the internet as the "rainbow subscribe animation." To be honest, to make today's episode, I watched over 100 different YouTube videos and re-recorded and uploaded videos to YouTube in more than 20 different ways. Welcome to Seeko Official Show YouTube Secrets. Now let's begin. Well, I know that 99% of you don't know about this feature because it's so secret. But if it's so secret, how did I find out about it? Actually, I was watching random videos on YouTube, and suddenly this video appeared in front of me. And I was literally shocked, like, what is happening? Which world are we living in? Then, after watching this one video, I thought that if this animation is appearing in this one video, then this animation must appear in every YouTube video when someone says "like" and "subscribe." And then I played more than 100 videos where people were asking for likes and subscribes. Subscribe to the channel, subscribe, subscribe to Aashish Sachlani Vines. And if I thought that this feature was only working on some selected videos, not all, then I uploaded these selected videos to YouTube in many different ways â€“ some with subtitles, some without; some with background music, some without. Do you know what happened? All my hard work went to waste.  Meaning, none of the videos I recorded and uploaded showed this rainbow animation. Then I thought, let's research this topic further so I can guide you all on what this feature actually is. It's not like that because YouTube has set a limit for this feature, where this animation will only be shown once in a video within 3 minutes, or if your video is very long. Check if this animation is working on your channel or not. And keep watching for more YouTube content like this. YouTube Secrets.
