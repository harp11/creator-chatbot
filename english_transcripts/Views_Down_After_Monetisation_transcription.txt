Friends, I saw a post on YouTube's official blog where a user wrote that his YouTube channel was regularly getting 9-15 thousand views. But as soon as his YouTube channel was monetized, meaning the viewership dropped by ten percent. Just after a YouTube channel is monetized. To check this, I went to Reddit and saw what people were searching for.  I searched "after I got monetized," and there you'll find hundreds of similar questions where people are saying the same thing: that after their YouTube channel was monetized, their views went down. And if so, how can this be avoided? And many more questions that might come to a new YouTuber's mind.  Hello friends, I am Havas Singh, and welcome to Official YouTube Secrets. Let's learn something new today. See, what used to happen before was that on YouTube, until you had 1000 subscribers and 4000 watch time hours, meaning your YouTube channel wasn't monetized, ads weren't shown on your videos. Because that money wouldn't come to you, but YouTube would earn all the money. Now, look, this update came recently, but before this update came, you could also do this experiment: if you have a monetized channel, upload one video with ads disabled and another video with ads enabled. You will see that the one with ads disabled gets more views. It's Over Expectations. Before monetization, we think that our channel, after being monetized, will earn us 10,000, 50,000, 100,000, 200,000 rupees a month like others. But after monetization, you actually find out, and your channel views drop. So, the conclusion of today's video is that views don't drop at all after monetization; you just have to maintain consistency and quality.
