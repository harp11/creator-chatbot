Friends, if you also lack time and can't spend 6-7 hours making YouTube videos, and if you make videos on trending topics, the trend ends before you can finish, then it would be better for you to make evergreen content.  This way, views will keep coming to your channel. To understand better, if you make one video on "Top 10 News of August 15, 2024" and another video on "Top 10 Facts of August 15," the news video will be a trending topic, but the facts video will be evergreen content. If you understand what evergreen content is, then let me tell you three methods today, after which you will never lack evergreen content topics.  And the last part is the most important:  Whatever kind of videos you make, you must first figure out your audience's biggest problem. And you should try to pick the most common problem, not decide on a topic based on one or two comments and make a video on it.

Method No. 2: Use AnswerThePublic, Ubersuggest, Quora, or Reddit.  With the help of these platforms, you can find out what people are searching for the most on the internet.  I can't explain each one in detail, otherwise, this video would become 10-15 minutes long. These tools will show you what people are searching for the most online. AnswerThePublic or Ubersuggest show topics with the most searches, indicating that the topic is evergreen and will always be in demand.

Method Number 3, which is the most popular, is manual content research. Make lists of all the topics. Then read each topic one by one to see if any trending topic has been covered, and if its trend has ended. If so, avoid those topics.

Using these three methods, you won't lack evergreen content, your views won't decrease, and you can quickly grow your YouTube channel in less time. How did you like the content?  Please tell me in the feedback. Thanks for watching.
