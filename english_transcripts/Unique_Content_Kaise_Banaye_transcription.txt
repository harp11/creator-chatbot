Friends, after Corona, the competition on YouTube has become very intense.  Growing on YouTube is not as easy as it was in 2017-18.  And how to create unique and engaging content is what we're going to understand in the next 3 minutes, so keep watching.

The first method is to follow trends. Whenever a new trend comes into the market, it automatically attracts more people. If you create your content on any trending topic as quickly as possible and make a creative video immediately, your content will be uploaded first and more people will watch your video.

The second method is title manipulation. Most creators do what other creators are doing.  For example, if someone has made a video "How to start a YouTube channel," many others will use titles like, "Don't start YouTube before watching this," or "Start making money in just 30 days from YT."  These titles grab the audience's attention and make them think the content is familiar but offers something new to learn, making your content seem unique.

The third method has five parts, and each is better than the last.  First is Quora. Quora is a Q&A platform where people ask their real problems and questions. Search according to your niche and then see which topics don't have videos on YouTube and create content on those. Here, search for good YouTube content ideas or creative video ideas and see what people are searching for.
