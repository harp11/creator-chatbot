Friends, are you also looking for viral video topics for your YouTube channel? If you make videos on these topics, there's a 90% chance your video will go viral. First, you need to see what kind of videos you make on your channel, like gaming, cooking, vlogging, or unboxing. This command means that Chat GPT will tell you the most popular or most-watched topics in your category. What will this do? This will show you the top videos made on that particular macro keyword, which are recently uploaded and performing best.  And every morning, you have to search on YouTube one by one and follow the same process. Then you'll see all the videos in your category that have recently been trending and could go viral. You have to watch them very carefully and create something better with good SDO (I assume this refers to a video's overall quality or something similar) and a good thumbnail. Within 24 or 48 hours, we have to publish our video so that our video doesn't become old before it's uploaded. Now, just as I told you to check the recent videos of 30 keywords one by one daily, similarly, you will have to search for 30 keywords one by one once a week and also touch upon most viewed videos. Now, what will happen by doing this whole process? I'll explain it to you in very simple language. If you follow the first step, where we followed recent videos, and if you upload daily videos, then you will have to do this process daily. If you do it once in two days, then you will have to do it once in two days.
