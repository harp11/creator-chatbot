On my YouTube channel, I have a setting enabled that prevents spam comments and inappropriate comments.  And although I filter words I find unsuitable, some comments still slip through using inappropriate language, demotivating me or spamming to promote something.  "Hello guys, welcome back to the official show YouTube Secrets. Now let's begin. First, fully open the YouTube Studio desktop version on your mobile phone." After this, no one will be able to post links in comments on your channel.  If someone tries to post a link, their link will be blocked and won't be visible to the public.  As soon as someone uses these inappropriate words in a comment, their comment will be immediately blocked and won't be visible to anyone. Then go to the top and tap on "Filter". But if you start comment moderation by checking this, then four different options will appear: None, Basic, Strict, or Hold All.  "None" will have no restrictions. Basic will block with slightly less sensitivity. Then if you tap on "Strict", blocked words will be blocked very strictly. And lastly, there's "Hold".
