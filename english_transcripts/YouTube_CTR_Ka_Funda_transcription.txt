My one video got a 2.5% CTR, it only got 325 views, and YouTube didn't recommend it to anyone at all.  On the other hand, another video of mine got a 7% CTR, and YouTube itself recommended it to 95% of viewers. If you run a YouTube channel or want to start one, in the next 10 minutes I will tell you the secrets that 99% of YouTubers don't know. Because the YouTube algorithm is a machine; it doesn't know whether your video is good or bad. Well, I know that you also wouldn't know about all this in advance.  Therefore, in the next 8 minutes I'm going to explain everything to you in detail. And in the last part, I've told you all how to achieve more than 15% CTR, so that your every video gets millions of views, so don't skip that part at all. Also don't forget to share this series with all your fellow creators. Now let's begin.
