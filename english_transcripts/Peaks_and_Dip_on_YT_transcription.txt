YouTube Studio provides two features that show you where your audience is watching your videos more and where less. Understanding these is crucial. Hello Guys, Welcome back to Seekh Official Show YouTube Secrets. Now, Let's Begin.  This is my mobile screen; you can see the first video has 13,000 views. I simply tap here.  Understanding these three things is very important because these are the three things that make your videos viral. See, first, "Top Moment" means if we find that a particular portion of our video has been watched attentively by the audience, then we have to study it and create the entire video similarly, so that the entire video is watched attentively by the audience. For example, I found that my video has three different spikes, not one, three different spikes. And from this, I understand that at these three particular points, the audience watched my video the most.  And after studying those points, if I apply those points to every video, there's a very high chance that every video will receive a good response. Now, let's say I tap on any video with fewer views. Here, in my video, there are two top moments, two spikes, and three dips. That kind of content should be removed from my video, and wherever the spike is coming, that kind of content should be added more to the video. If I do this, top moments will remain in my video, and spikes will keep coming.
