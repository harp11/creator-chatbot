Whether your YouTube channel is new or old, YouTube is bringing a fantastic new tool for all of you.  And as soon as this tool launches, I'm telling you, many creators' worries will be over.  Imagine this scenario: something spoken in your video gets muted, and your video's performance drops drastically.  In this case, YouTube is bringing a great update.  Suppose in this vlog, you haven't played any song, but there's a song playing in the background.  Due to that song, the song's audio gets recorded in your video, and when you upload that vlog to YouTube, your video will continue to run smoothly.  As soon as your video starts earning money—whether today or tomorrow, you will earn eventually—a copyright claim, a few seconds long, will appear on your video.  Now, we didn't add that; it was playing in the background.  But because of that background music, a copyright claim will appear. And as soon as that claim appears, the earnings from your video might go entirely to them.  What's our fault in this case? We were just making a normal vlog. If there's background music playing in our video, it's not our fault. But after this upcoming feature on YouTube, you can mute only the background music.  Meaning you'll get two features: "Erase Song" and "Mute Audio," and "Dispute." You can use "Erase Song," after which your voice won't be deleted.
