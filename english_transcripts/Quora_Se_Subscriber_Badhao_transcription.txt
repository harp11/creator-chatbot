There's nothing better than Quora for promoting your YouTube channel for free because this platform has over 40 crore (400 million) active users every month.  Don't skip the last 30 seconds where I've explained the rules; if you don't follow them, your Quora account can be banned. Before promoting, download the Quora app from the Play Store. You'll need to add some details: your occupation, education, residence, and languages you know.  Then search for relevant topics—cooking, tutorials, etc.—and find posts with the most upvotes (upvotes here mean popularity). For example, I searched "GTA V Mods," found a post with many upvotes, and saw it had millions of views. I then went to YouTube because people were searching for the same topic in millions, the same topic as my video.  Everything I've said so far is useless if you don't know Quora's Terms and Conditions.  Don't just post links; provide a complete answer in the text before posting the link. Rule number three: only share videos related to the question asked on Quora. Bonus tip: create a new channel, make a list of Quora's most popular questions in a specific category, and create videos on those topics to share daily on Quora.
