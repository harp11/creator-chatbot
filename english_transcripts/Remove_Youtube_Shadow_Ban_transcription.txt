YouTube Shadowban. Have you heard this word for the first time? If yes, then in the next 2 minutes, I'm going to tell you a secret like yours. You may have hardly ever thought about this before. Many channels make small mistakes, and for some time, they completely shut down your channel. Now, those whose channels YouTube has shut down for some time, they are called Shadowbanned. So, check once using a tool if your channel is Shadowbanned or not. And there's a very simple process to check it, which we will learn in the next one minute. Hello guys, welcome to Seekho Official Show YouTube Secrets. Now let's begin. Now, there can be two cases. First, your watch time is 10+ minutes per video and the watch time for every video is 40%+, and second, it's not like that. So, in the first case, if your views are not coming, to fix this, you just need one month. For the next one month, you will have to run a small process, for which you will first have to go to YouTube Studio and then to Analytics. Especially pay attention to this that all videos should have a 40%+ audience retention rate, and CTR should also be 10%+ and within one month, the shadowban on your channel will be removed, and your views will start coming.
