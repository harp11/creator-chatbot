If you want to make your YouTube videos viral, increase audience retention. You must have heard this before, but nobody is telling you how much watch time each video should have. In a short while, I'll show you practical proof of this. But first, let's understand what audience retention is, how it's measured, and what it actually means.  What is a perfect audience retention rate, and how can you find out?

Look, I'll explain this with proof from my own channel. This is one of my videos that has 26 lakh views and is 39 minutes long. Yet, this video went viral.  On the same channel, I have another video that's only eight minutes long, and its audience retention is 2 minutes and 41 seconds, which is 33.6%.

Now, these points are quite debatable; every expert has a different opinion. But if you listen to me, YouTube prefers videos that people watch for longer.  Actually, YouTube benefits when people spend more time on a video. YouTube promotes those videos faster.

My suggestion to you is to make longer videos. Still, just to give you an idea, the most popular YouTube videos that are ten minutes long have an average video duration of five minutes.
