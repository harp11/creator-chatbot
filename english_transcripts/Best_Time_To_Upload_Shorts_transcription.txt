If you create YouTube Shorts, you must have wondered when is the best time to upload them. Let's begin.  Straight to the point: First, I go to my YT studio, then to the 'Content' tab, and then to 'Shorts'.  You'll see that I've only made 3 shorts on my channel, which have received decent views. Now, I'll click on the first short and go to its insights to show you how upload timing affects a short's performance. See, this short video has received 57,000 views, and if I show you the graph of its first 24 hours of views, you'll see I uploaded it at 9 PM.  That night, the short received 1035 views. You'll see that initially, the video got absolutely no views, but then it suddenly boomed.  From this, I got an idea that short videos don't get views initially. Now, I uploaded this video at 9 PM, but let me show you another video that I uploaded early in the morning. This short video has received 100,000 views, at a time when there is very little active traffic. But if I go to its first seven days' performance, you'll see that the views are similar to the previous video. Whether you upload at 12 AM or 3 AM, if your content is good, YouTube will definitely push it.
