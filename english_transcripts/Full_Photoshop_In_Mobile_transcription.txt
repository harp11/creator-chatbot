Imagine, friends, without downloading any app, you can use a computer's Photoshop 100% free on your mobile phone, with the latest AI features. And in the next 30 seconds, I'll tell you the website name and three features you won't find in Photoshop. So, don't skip even a single second of those 30 seconds. Now, let's begin.  Scrolling down, the first thing you see is "Fully Local," meaning when you import any local file or large file here, it doesn't upload to the internet first. This makes your editing experience very smooth. Then it says "Cost-Effective," meaning the premium features that cost you three to four thousand rupees per month in Photoshop... and then "Professional Editor," meaning this app gives you all the basic and advanced tools of Photoshop.  Whether it's cropping, advanced color grading, like one-click background removal from a photo, or replacing a part of a photo with another image, generative fill options are also available here. You can learn to use Photoshop for free by tapping on the tutorials shown at the top of the homepage.  Second, templates: by tapping on the templates shown at the top of the homepage, you can use them with all the features I've just mentioned. The website name is Photopea, which you can directly search on Google. Remember, the better your device, the better this website will work.
