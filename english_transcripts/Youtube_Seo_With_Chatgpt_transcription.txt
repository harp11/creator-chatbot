Friends, the new version of ChatGPT is so advanced that you just write a magical prompt, write your video's topic, and as soon as you hit enter, in just 5-10 seconds you'll get your YouTube video ad... And the last one is most important, so don't miss the end. As a professional SEO expert, help me create the most optimized title, description, and tags for my YouTube video, whose content is [XYZ].  After which, ChatGPT will work like a professional SEO expert for us, providing us with a highly optimized title, tags, and description. But will doing just this be enough? Not so quickly. Because now comes the next step. We've defined the rules, but now we need to define which specific rules to follow to create an SEO optimized title. We'll write three different rules for a good title.  Meaning that the title should be a maximum of 5 to 6 words so that people understand it instantly. Second, it must be engaging and clickable, using words that are relatable and encourage the maximum number of clicks. Meaning the title should be so interesting and logical that people will click on it more. Third, ensure the title is SEO friendly, using keywords that are most searched on YouTube so that the video can rank. After writing this, the title will be something you couldn't have thought of yourself. Second, in the first paragraph, use the most popular and relevant keywords that are highly searched on YouTube. Meaning, use keywords in the first paragraph that are searched the most on YouTube. Third, end the description with 10 short-tail hashtags that are closely related to the title and content. That is, at the end of the description, we'll use 10 small hashtags related to our content. Now comes the most important section, which is tags, because this is the power that takes your video to the right audience. For tags, you will also have to write three different conditions. Namely, five keywords that have low competition and on which your video can rank quickly. And these keywords will help you generate initial traffic even in tough competition. Third, find 5 keywords related to relevant subtopics of the video. Meaning, five keywords that will help feature your content within the related content of your video. And this is the final command that you can also write after posting your video. Just write your video topic in place of XYZ and you will get advanced SEO for your video. Thanks for watching.
