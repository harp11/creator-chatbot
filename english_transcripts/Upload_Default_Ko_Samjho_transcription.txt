Hello YouTubers, let's show some magic. This is my YouTube Studio. Here, I go to "Simply Create," then to "Upload Video," and here we upload any video. And if you also want to, before your video is uploaded, you can write the title, tags, description, everything.  Along with this, you can set whether the video should be unlisted, private, or public. So, on your mobile phone or laptop, you have to go to studio.youtube.com.  Simply, I type here studio.youtube.com, and then, on our phone, just like on a computer or laptop, the YT Studio will open. Then you have to tap on "Upload Defaults." After tapping here, if you zoom out a little, it will be clearly visible on a laptop, and on the first try. After going here, you will see that YouTube's upload defaults mean the meta tags you use repeatedly for your videos, like the things you write in every title, like your channel name. Now, because I make videos on online earning on my YouTube channel every time, I have modified my title and description accordingly. You can see it here. Therefore, we will keep this set to Unlisted so that when we upload and save a video, our video doesn't go live directly. After that, you can also manage the advanced settings here, like which category you want to upload the video in. You won't have to select it repeatedly. And lastly, there's monetization. Yes, you have to modify every title and copy according to the video. But with the help of this YouTube feature, setting up videos becomes much easier.  For repetitive things.
