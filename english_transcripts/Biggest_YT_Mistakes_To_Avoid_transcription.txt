Gultek is a YouTube channel with 275,000 subscribers and 908 uploaded videos.  It hasn't published a video in the last 3 months.  Another channel, MySmartSport, has 1.37 million subscribers and its videos get millions of views, yet it hasn't created a video in the last year. Why?  Many explain how to grow on YouTube, but few explain common mistakes to avoid. This episode is dedicated to those mistakes.  If you're a new... Greetings friends, I'm [name] from "How to Learn YouTube Secrets," welcome! Let's learn something new today.

Mistake #1: Not upgrading your content.  MySmartSport is a prime example.  It has 1.38 million subscribers and about 14 lakh (1.4 million) subscribers, yet its videos get only around 10,000 views. They used to create great content, but they didn't upgrade it, falling behind others.

Mistake #2: Not understanding your audience. Create content your audience wants, not what you want. I've made that mistake on my channel.  Look at MySmartSport's popular videos â€“ they're mostly sponsored videos or about how to start a micro-niche blog.  This content doesn't interest their audience. When they occasionally post YouTube tips, views increase significantly. We need to understand our target audience and what they want to watch.

Mistake #3: Lack of consistency.  Consistent uploads bring traffic even to older videos.  One month-old video might get 3000 views, while a year-old video might get 47,000. More uploads lead to more output and data.

MySmartSport also made mistakes with sponsorships. Over-reliance on sponsors can alienate the audience, who might perceive it as excessive promotion.  Sponsorships should be balanced, relevant to the channel, and not overwhelming.
