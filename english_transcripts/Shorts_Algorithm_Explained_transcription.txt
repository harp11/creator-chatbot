Friends, have you ever thought about how a short video goes viral? How does the algorithm work to make a short video viral? Today, in my white studio, I have one, two, three, four, five such videos. If you make short videos on YouTube, you should know about three different factors that help YouTube's algorithm make your videos viral very quickly. YouTube's algorithm considers only three things for a short video to go viral. The first is – I'll show you live what it is – a graph showing your video's audience retention. Now, the video I've made is 57 seconds long, and the average retention rate here is coming to 0.35 seconds, and the audience retention here is around 62%. But does this alone make our videos viral? The answer is absolutely not. If you make short videos, this is factor number one, but just having more views on your video will never make your shorts viral. Now comes factor number two, which is our swipe ratio. If you go to reach, you'll see here 77.1% viewed your video. Out of a hundred people, 77.1% of them watched my video, okay? And out of those, only 22.9% skipped my video after watching a little.  Skipping happens when your video's hook isn't good. Here, on this 9.2k video, we touch it and go to reach. You'll see here that 50% of people watched my video and 50% skipped the video. So this video wasn't promoted much by YouTube, it didn't go viral.  Good watch time is there, but Factor No. 2 is that your hook should be good. And now let's talk about Factor No. 3, which is the most important in the YouTube algorithm for making short videos viral: Content Selection. If you create content that, even if the retention rate is very good, even if the swipe ratio is very good, but if you make a video that targets a broad audience, targets a lot of people, targets different age groups, then your videos will definitely go viral. Therefore, if you also want to make your YouTube Shorts viral, whether you make a three-second short, a ten-second short, or a fifty-second short, you only need to keep one thing in mind: that your swipe ratio should be good, and then see how your Shorts go viral. If you liked the content, rate it from bad to best. Thanks for watching.
