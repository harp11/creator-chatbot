Basic, basic, but those things, if taken seriously, nothing can stop your channel from growing. For some time, I've been thinking that if I had three lakhs on my YouTube channel, what five steps would I follow first?  I'm sharing those with you in the next few minutes. Now, if you also want to boost subscribers on your YouTube channel, first decide what your YouTube channel will be about. New YouTubers initially upload anything on their YouTube channel. Step No. 2: Make good content. Everyone says that to grow on YouTube, you need to create good content, but no one tells what good content is. In your and my opinion, good content can mean anything. Suppose you made a video, "How To Grow On YouTube," and made two different versions of that video: one with fancy editing without research, and the other with deep research in basic quality. Step 3: Regularly upload videos. People think that regularly uploading videos means uploading a video every day, but that's not the case. It means that before starting the channel, decide how many and when you will upload videos in a day, a week, or a month. Some people say that uploading more videos will make you grow faster, but that's not true. Uploading more videos doesn't lead to growth but gives you more opportunities to experiment. If one video becomes a hit, you get views, but... Step No. 4: Pay attention to SEO. My friend, if you want to grow on YouTube, you have to follow YouTube's rules, right? Take SEO lightly, and it's game over. Listen carefully. SEO doesn't mean spending hours doing keyword research or finding viral texts using paid tools. No, but nowadays YouTube is so intelligent that even without reading the title, tags, and description, it understands what your video is about and who should be shown the video. What's different in your video compared to other videos that makes people click on it? Your title and thumbnail will decide this. Simple: Don't use tags, don't write a description, it's fine. And if you do this, YouTube will also support you. Step Five: Go with trends and audience interest. This is the biggest mistake that took me a very long time to personally understand.  Where engagement is high, it means people are interested in that content. And if you keep all these things in mind while creating your content, your channel will grow organically very fast. See you very soon in another explosive video.
