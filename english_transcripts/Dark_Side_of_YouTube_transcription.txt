A very big game is being played with new YouTubers, a game they don't even know about, especially on YouTube.  Whenever you go to watch YouTube tips, what do you find?  And you can definitely do it, but keeping some things in mind. If you don't pay attention to these things, you might end up ruined like the other YouTubers who have already been ruined. And lastly, there's something that if you don't keep in mind, your YouTube career can be ruined anytime. So don't skip that at all. Now, let's begin. Look, first understand one thing, and within the next five years, out of those fifty, only three or four will continue. The remaining forty-five will shut down.  Meaning, if you calculate the success ratio, it's four or five companies out of a thousand that are successful. But how can you be among these 3-4 people? You need to understand this. First, if you get inspired by someone on YouTube, you'll invest money there, but your money will be wasted. Second thing, let's say they're not promoting any other website. You won't be able to do anything. YouTube is a game where you have to stick around for a long time. I started my YouTube channel in 2015, and I'm still working on it today.  Even today, when I was studying in 10th and 12th grade, I used to only give YouTube about an hour.  I'm not saying I didn't do it, but studies were my priority.  For example, as soon as they showed their face, the audience started criticizing them, and they were forced to delete the video and start making videos with a mask again on their channel. So don't do it in front of the entire audience at once. Do it in front of a small audience, and then experiment to see how the audience is responding. After that, reveal it to a large number of subscribers.  Next, read this news where it's writtenâ€¦otherwise your downfall will begin immediately.  And read this news where PewDiePie said some absurd things in his video, because of which very big brands stopped sponsoring him.
