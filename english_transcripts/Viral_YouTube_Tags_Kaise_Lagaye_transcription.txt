Friends, do you also feel that you make very good videos, but for some reason your videos don't go viral? Now here you will find almost all new, old, good, and bad videos made on this topic in the search, but we only have to find those videos which are latest, made a few days ago, and among millions of videos. For this, what will we do? We will tap on the filter above, and first of all, in "Sort By," instead of "Relevance," we will tap on "View Count." After that, we will be shown the videos first which have been uploaded in the last 28 days and which have the most views, i.e., only the best-performing viral videos. Now you only have to see the top 5 videos appearing on top. Now, we can easily see the title, thumbnail, and description of any video, but how can we know their tags? How will we know what tags others have used? Well, this has a very simple formula. This method will only give you the metadata that is performing best on YouTube at this time. How did you like the content?  Please tell me in the comments. Thanks for watching.
