Friends, today I'm going to tell you all about three YouTube settings that you absolutely cannot ignore. Ignoring these settings can lead to significant losses.  First, I'll tell you about three settings. The first setting is Super Chats. What are Super Chats, what are their benefits, and how can you enable them? Let's understand this. You'll have to go to your phone. After tapping here, you'll go to Super Chats, and you'll see on my YouTube channel, Super Stickers, Super Chats, and along with that, Super Thanks â€“ all three are enabled.  Meaning, with just one click, I got 150 rupees here. Above that, you see someone paying 39 rupees, someone 20 rupees. And if I tap "See all," you'll see you simply have to come to YouTube Studio and enable these three settings. Now, let's talk about the second setting.  The one shown below, if you click this setting button, now this, sometimes gets accidentally turned on. Being turned on means ads will be shown on your YouTube channel that your users aren't interested in. Now, what are its advantages and disadvantages? I'll explain that to you. Now let's talk about today's third setting, which is Moderators. Now what are Moderators? Let's understand that. See, you'll get an option here, Community. You'll tap here. On your YouTube channel, many times, many spam comments come, or someone shares their links on your YouTube channel, someone shares their number. Now, these are also of different types, like Managing Moderators, Standard Moderators, they are different, okay? We'll talk about them sometime else. Below that, Approved Users means that whatever they comment, their comment will be visible. Because I have very limited time, I can only tell you this much briefly.  If you want a dedicated episode on any of these things, you can tell me in the feedback.
