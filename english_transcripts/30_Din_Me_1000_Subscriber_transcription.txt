Sir, is it possible to get 1000 subscribers in 30 days?  Yes, absolutely! You just need to follow 3 steps. After that, not only 1000, but 10,000 followers will also be achieved.  Also, at the end of today's episode, something that adds value to someone's life, something they can learn from, or something that makes them want to rewatch your videos.  We get value from content that teaches us something, or content we want to rewatch. So step no. 1 is that we shouldn't chase views. We have to create dedicated content that has some value. Now, what are calls to action?  Many creators make video after video – comedy, fun, entertainment, all different kinds of videos – but in the entire video, they don't even once ask to subscribe. But your method should be engaging. And whenever you talk about a call to action, there should be some value hidden in it, something that compels the user to subscribe to your channel. For example, let me share some CTAs with you. If you want to watch daily finance news, subscribe to our channel. Basically, you have to give a reason in your CTA, and then you have to ask them to subscribe. Because shorts videos go viral very quickly, and subscribers grow very fast on shorts videos. For example, check out this YouTube channel. Make well-designed videos with good visuals, and there you go, your video is ready. And friends, by just keeping these three things in mind, you too can significantly increase the speed of subscriber growth on your YouTube channel.
