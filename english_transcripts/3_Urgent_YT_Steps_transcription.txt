Friends, if you are a YouTube video creator, I'm going to tell you three steps you should take right now.  This means, as soon as the episode ends, you should do these three steps immediately. How much time do you spend making a video? Some take two hours, some take four. If I talk about myself, it takes me at least eight to ten hours to make a video.  Or, if back-to-back strikes hit your channel, or due to any XYZ condition, a fake strike causes your channel to be deleted or taken away from youâ€”you should copy both of these (the strike information and the channel deletion scenario) and write them down in a notebook, or store them in a particular notepad. So that, if YouTube asks us, we can provide them immediately.  After that, you will simply go to Settings, and after going to Settings, you will go to Advanced Settings. There you will find your channel's URL and the channel ID. So, two steps are done: first, the channel URL, and second, the channel ID.  The third is to back up all your videos.  You should have a proper backup of all the videos you have uploaded to your channel, with full quality. All the details, everything, it's our responsibility to keep everything safe. Now, these three steps are such that if you haven't taken them yet, you should take them today itself.
