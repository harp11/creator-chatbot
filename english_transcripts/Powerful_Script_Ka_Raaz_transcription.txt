Just check out the videos of Druv Rathee, Nitish Rajput, Ranveer Allahbadia, or any other popular YouTuber. Once you start watching, you won't want to stop.  So your videos will be unskippable, even with practical examples. And yes, at the end, there are three secrets you absolutely cannot ignore. So, don't miss the end.

First, we need to know if your scripting is correct or incorrect. The very simple answer is that whenever a user opens the YouTube app, they are shown thumbnails of many videos with different interests. But they click on only one. This shows us that every user who comes to our video wants to watch our video. But even after getting views, if your video doesn't have good audience retention, whatever topic you make a video on, make it so compelling that the viewer doesn't want to watch any other video on that topic after watching yours. Or if you have a tutorial channel, try to explain as much as possible in the least amount of time. For example, you are learning from my powerful script secret in this episode.

After short-form content, people have no patience left.  Therefore, you have to make your video scripting so fast that the user doesn't even have time to think about another video. Like this episode, I'm creating curiosity one after another.

Second, whether your video is one minute long or ten minutes long, you have to divide it into three sections: intro, body, and outro. The intro should have the most energy.  Where you are telling the most important part of the body. To keep the viewer hooked until the outro. If your videos are long, you have to divide the video into different parts, creating different subtopics. Then each subtopic should be treated as if it's not a subtopic, but a full video in itself.
