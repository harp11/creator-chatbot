Friends, having your video rank on YouTube doesn't mean it ranked for just a minute or two. Let's search a keyword here and see: "Upwork Beginner to Advanced Tutorial," which you can also search.  When you search it on YouTube, you'll see my video ranking at the top. And this isn't from today or a couple of days ago.  If you need more proof, I'll go to my YT Studio, and you'll see that on my YouTube channel in 2024, 1.3 million views came solely from YouTube search.  That means the majority of my traffic comes from YouTube search. But the question arises: Sir, we create very good content, use good SEO, but our videos still don't rank.  If yours ranks, how does that happen? Today, I'm not going to give you any B-to-B tutorial, like using this tag or that. We won't discuss that. Today, we'll discuss something very practical and unique. You have to tap here. After tapping, you can treat your phone as if you just bought it and are using YouTube without logging in. Now, whenever you search something, after doing this, you'll need to search whatever topic you want to make a video on. Let's say I search, "How to create a Facebook page." As soon as I search this keyword, what basically happens on YouTube is that the ranking changes every second.  That is, one video is ranking now, and after five minutes, another video will rank. Some videos, which aren't very good, rank on YouTube for a few seconds. Those that are slightly better rank for a minute or two.  I personally use this method to find and improve my content.  The method is that you have to test at three different times on YouTube, not just one. Whatever topic you want to make a video on, you have to search it on YouTube. Now you see, we have many videos here. After that, we'll save these screenshots.  In the afternoon, we'll search the same keyword again on YouTube. When you search the same keyword again on YouTube, we'll get screenshots of all ten videos. After that, we'll repeat the process again and take screenshots around 6-7 pm in the evening.  That means you've taken screenshots at three different times. You have to match which videos are ranking at all three times. Because YouTube ranking works in two ways. Some content always ranks, and some content ranks for some time and then disappears.  So, if you want to stay at the top, you have to create content that always ranks. If you find any logic in my talk, please let me know in the feedback: "Yes, sir, you told something good today, and I'll try this trick." Tell me in the feedback what you learned from today's video so I know how much you understood. Thanks for watching.
