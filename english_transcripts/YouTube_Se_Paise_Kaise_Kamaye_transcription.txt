Friends, have you ever felt that the videos you watch on YouTube, you could also make?  Yes! Then you don't understand where to start. Now, if you're also thinking of creating your own YouTube channel and earning money from it, but you have zero knowledge of YouTube, then this episode is going to be special for you. The first question that might come to your mind is: what kind of content should I create? There's a lot of content. But if you want to earn money from YouTube, you first have to do a small experiment and then you have to think about starting your YouTube channel in that field. Because when you create content on YouTube according to your interests, to put it very simply, you don't get money from YouTube views, likes, comments, and subscribers. Rather, you earn from the ads shown to people before your videos play. There are two different ways to monetize a YouTube channel. Either you complete 4000 watch hours within a year, or secondly, in three months on Shorts videos. Some people have a doubt: Sir, I haven't reached 1000 subscribers yet, but ads are showing on my videos, but I'm not earning anything.  You will get this. Besides YouTube, there are many other ways to earn money, such as Sponsorship, Refer and Earn, Affiliate Marketing, and Merchandise, along with Super Chat and Super Stickers, which further boost your earnings.  You can watch these three videos one by one, which will let you know how to earn money on YouTube. How did you like the content?  Tell me in the feedback.
