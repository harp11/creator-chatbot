Just as you invest in a business, work hard for years, and then start making a profit, so it is with our YouTube channel.  We need to know what tricks hackers use to hack a YouTube channel. In today's episode, I'm going to be a hacker, and you have to figure out how to protect yourself from me.  I'm going to tell you all my tricks.

First, if I want to hack someone's YouTube channel, if it says you'll get a year's recharge free, a month's recharge free, people will share it themselves. So you need to stay away from such links.

Second, if I see a YouTuber's email address and password in their video, and if you think you've shared it by mistake, you need to change your password instantly.

Third, if I know I have a friend with a very good YouTube channel, if you are a YouTuber, you should not give your account login phone to any untrusted person, no matter how close they are.

Do you know that there are tools in the market that can try millions of passwords in seconds? If any password matches, your account gets hacked.

Last and final, the most dangerous method, which is how big channels get hacked, is tracking data on fake websites.  Your Chrome browser, your Yahoo browser—whatever browser you use—stores your passwords, bank account details, credit card details, everything.  In seconds, your data can be stolen.

If you receive an email with a link to download a PDF, application, or game, and you go to the drive and download that file, you should always have a separate email for sponsors where you can open third-party links. And second, you should have a separate device where you can access your YouTube channel.
