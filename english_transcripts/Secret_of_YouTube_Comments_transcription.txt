And dude, my mind was blown when I found out that my videos are also watched by people with more than 10 million subscribers. And you know that you can greatly increase engagement on your channel with the help of this feature. And yes, friends, the last one is my favorite, which you cannot skip. So if you also want to increase engagement on your channel, you can watch today's episode from beginning to end.  Hello friends, I am Hawasing. First of all, let's look very carefully at the YouTube comments interface to see what features we get to see. So if you go to comments, on your dashboard, if we go to the very beginning, the good ones should have been public, but YouTube hid them. So your first job will be to keep the good comments on your channel. After that, you can go to the response status and here you can touch on "I haven't responded".  Then all the comments you haven't yet replied to will come up. And you can filter and reply to everyone. And it becomes a very rare thing for them and chances are they will watch all your upcoming videos. Now, the third option we have is search, this is the best one, we will talk about it last. After that, we have content questions, this is also a point to talk about last. And the last option we have is subscriber count. Now here I touch it so that I can see the comments of my subscribers who have more than 10,000 subscribers. Look, I have many comments here from people with more than 10,000 subscribers. But the amazing thing is that people with more than one million subscribers have also commented a lot on my channel. And this lets me know that my videos are also watched by people with more than one million subscribers. Now imagine, with this comment filter, you can find out how many subscribers your subscribers have. Now, in very short, there are many benefits to getting comments. But now I'm going to tell you the tricks by using which you can increase comments on your channel very quickly. So if even a thousand people watch your video, you will easily get 50 comments. Third, you can also say that I will give a shout-out in the next video to the person whose comment is the best. You can run a Q&A. Every week you can bring an episode where you reply to your subscribers' comments. Now doing this will have two benefits. One, you have replied to all the comments.
