Friends, I accidentally searched "USA channel" on YouTube, and look what came up: "Earn ten lakh rupees a month working from home with Chat GPT plus AI USA Shorts," from a USA Automation channel showing $54,765 revenue, about 45 lakh rupees.  But I suddenly wondered, "Is this even possible?"  Then I started deep research on this topic, and what I found will blow your mind. Today's video is only three minutes long. I've also explained how you can earn money from a USA channel even if you don't know English. So don't miss it, and now let's begin. But what's written on these thumbnails isn't 100% true.  That level of earning is possible, but *this* level of earning isn't.  Such large amounts are written on thumbnails to get more clicks. First, understand that creating a USA channel while living in India isn't as easy as creating an Indian channel. This is the problem that prevents many people from creating USA channels. But don't worry, my friend, I'm here. I'll guide you on how to do it.  First, in settings, you'll have to select USA under region. And in channel keywords, you need to add all keywords related to your content that are most searched in the USA. But honestly, even after doing all this, you won't get views on videos immediately. Because people either make short videos or long videos, because shorts get traffic quickly, and once shorts get traffic, long videos also start getting traffic.
