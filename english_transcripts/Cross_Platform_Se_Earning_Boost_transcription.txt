Friends, where my brand manager gets a deal done for five thousand rupees, I get the same deal done for fifty thousand rupees minus a little expense.  The only difference is the way we talk. On the Cross-Platform, we've created a dedicated video on how you can increase views using the Cross-Platform.  Hello friends, I welcome you all to Havasng Seekho Official Show YouTube Secrets. Let's learn something new today. First, let's understand in a very short way what Cross-Platform is.  That you are publishing the content of one platform on multiple platforms. Now the question is, what do new YouTubers do? If on their channel, if on their Instagram, let's say a brand collaboration comes to my Instagram, who says to me that we have an AI tool, we have a business tool, which we want to promote. I tell them okay sir. But on the same point, if I tell them that I also have a YouTube channel, a Telegram page, as well as a Facebook page, and there are a few followers, a few subscribers there, I only have to create the content once. What are we doing? Just publishing the video, but our earnings will directly boost. The second trick you can use is you can offer a bonus. Like, if you go to buy Adobe software, you get one software expensively, two cheaply, three together, you will get even cheaper. Similarly, you have to tell the brand that if you sponsor on one platform, it will be expensive, but if you sponsor on two platforms, we can give you a combo offer. Like you can take ideas from screen shots, how you can offer brands your commercials. If you have learned anything new from today's episode, share it with others. Thanks for watching.
