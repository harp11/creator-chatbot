Friend, you must have seen many times on YouTube that very big YouTubers put tags in their descriptions, and not just one, but many tags.  Once you check a YouTube channel, as soon as you go to the description, you will see that they have used many tags one after another. Then, a little further down, you'll see so many tags there. You'll also see in their titles, they haven't used just one, but five or six different keywords. We will talk about all this in detail in today's video. Hello guys, welcome to Seekho Official, YouTube Secrets, where I teach you something new about YouTube every day.  And keyword stuffing is illegal in YouTube's eyes, and if you are caught doing this, a community guideline strike can be given on your channel for doing so on a single video. So look, the more you think about this question, the more difficult it becomes. Therefore, I explain all the things to you in a very simple way. But there are some clever people here who smartly take advantage of this, bypassing YouTube's rules and no strike comes. We will talk about that later. Secondly, what are its benefits? And this is the case, now look at anyone's earning YouTube channel, no one gets so many views. But if you go to their YouTube channel and play any of their latest videos, you will find something to notice, which you have to observe very carefully. I post the video, go to the description, come down a little, here you see one after another, different keys are written, but instead of separating them with commas, they are written in a separate column. And here, this is such a big channel, they have also made a mistake, that in their description, all the tags they have used, they have put a comma in all of them. This does not mean that I will tell you to also make such videos, also put such tags, no, no, you should not do that. What you have to do is, just copy the tags you have put in the video's tag box and paste them here. And just like I show you my latest video, what I have done here is that as you touch the video, after touching, you go to the description. Don't manipulate YouTube's algorithm. There will be problems in this case.  Just write the tags related to your video in the description. You have to write them in a way like this. So those who started this episode and are still watching, they must have understood this point 100%.
