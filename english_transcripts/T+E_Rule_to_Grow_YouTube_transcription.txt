Friends, no matter how many videos you make on YouTube, if you don't know about the T plus E rule, believe me, whether you work on YouTube for one year, two years, or ten years, you will be 100% insecure. You know that in the last three months, I must have uploaded a maximum of ten to twelve videos on my YouTube channel, but still, my YouTube channel consistently earns between twenty-five thousand and thirty thousand. And today I'm going to tell you a rule for planning content on YouTube, which, if you follow, will help you grow faster and earn more money. So, my brother, if you really want to become a YouTuber or if you have a YouTube channel, then today's episode is going to be very special for all of you because what I'm going to tell you today… first, let's understand what T plus E means. But let me also tell you that even after these two rules, there's another rule that's even more important than these two. We'll talk about that last. So, trending content is content that you create, and within the next 48 hours, your video starts getting views immediately. And what are these kinds of topics? They are issues raised based on the current situation.  Then there's evergreen content. What is that? These are videos that were watched five years ago, are being watched today, and will be watched five years from now. And you should create 50% evergreen content for your channel. Along with that, to get good views immediately and maintain real-time engagement, you can create trending videos, which will bring instant views to your channel. So, 30% of our content should be controversial—like a fight between YouTubers, a new game in the market that's being debated, or a topic that can be directly shared. When you create this kind of content, you get a chance to reach a new audience. Imagine YouTube gave you one view, and that one view is leading to 10-15 more views because they are sharing your video.  So your videos will get views in the long term, in real time, and you'll also get a chance to reach new people. Even if YouTube doesn't promote you, your subscribers will still support you. So the T plus E rule means Trending plus Evergreen, where you can add controversial topics as a bonus. And if you create videos in this way in any category, you will get 100% success.
