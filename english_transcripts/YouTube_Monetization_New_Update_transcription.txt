Friends, today I'm going to tell you all about a YouTube update that hasn't arrived yet, but is coming soon. I'm telling you about it first, and it's a really amazing update.  We'll learn what benefits you'll all get from this update and what things we need to keep in mind in today's episode. Just watch it till the end.

Previously, giving you different strikes, or even a Community Guideline strike, would disable your channel's monetization.  After that, you'd get an appeal option. But there was a gap of eight to ten days during which our monetization was disabled, and then re-enabled.  During this time, we didn't receive any earnings; all the earnings went to YouTube.

So, a major update is coming to YouTube.  Creator Insider's official YouTube channel has also mentioned this.  What will this update do?

This update means that if a Community Guideline strike comes on your YouTube channel, it might disable your monetization.  However, if you appeal within eight days and the YouTube team finds your channel to be compliant, your monetization won't be disabled, and your earnings won't be cut.

But what if we don't reply to YouTube, meaning we don't appeal, stating whether our content is correct or incorrect? In that case, what will YouTube do? After eight days, your channel's monetization will be re-enabled. However, if your fault is found, your channel's monetization will be disabled for 90 days.
