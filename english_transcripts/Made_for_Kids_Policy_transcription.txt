Whenever we upload a video on YouTube, we always face an option that we are compelled to answer.  You cannot upload the video without answering yes or no. And I have seen many big YouTube channels making this mistake â€“ they say yes when they should say no, or no when they should say yes. So, if you also run a channel and you don't know, let's first understand what this feature is. On November 12, 2019, the FTC (Federal Trade Commission), under COPPA (Children Online Privacy Act), passed a rule for YouTube creators.  Its intention was to provide privacy for kids on YouTube. But first, let's understand why it was created. Before 2019, YouTube had a lot of content that was not safe for young children to watch.  What will happen if you say yes and what will happen if you say no? If your content is made for children under 13 years of age, including poems, stories, or cartoons, then your content will fall under "Made for Kids." Doing this will ensure your content is shown only to the audience you intend to target. Saying yes will allow your video to be featured in the YouTube Kids application. However, saying yes will also disable comments on your video. I hope we have cleared your doubts about yes and no.  See you in the next episode, until then keep watching and keep learning.
