Friends, today I'm going to tell you all a secret that even those YouTubers with millions of subscribers don't know.  And if they do know, well, I've heard many people say, "I'm not getting my shift code, my account isn't receiving payments. It's been two or three months, and my payment is stuck. How do I get my payment?" Because the account I'm going to tell you about today has many advantages, but there are one or two disadvantages you should know, which I've discussed in about 30 seconds. Keep watching.

A normal YouTuber whose payment is $1,000 to $15,000, meaning lakhs and lakhs of rupees a month, what do they do? They open a normal savings account. But if you open a current account instead, you have the option to bargain with the bank – "I'll give you 0.2 paise per dollar, 0.10 paise, or 0.20 paise." So, you should open a savings account, but which savings account?  Look, there are many banks in the market that provide you with excellent facilities. And for the last 6-7 years, YouTube money has been coming into my account, that's why I'm telling you this.

Now look, you have two different options. If your payment is $100, $200, $500, but if your income crosses 20 lakhs, then as a YouTuber, it's mandatory to take GST, and you should receive your YouTube payments in a current account. There, you can save ₹1000-₹2000 on a $1000 payment.
