My friend has been uploading videos to YouTube Shorts for the past year and has acquired one million subscribers.  But when I asked him how much he earns from YouTube, he told me $200 per month.  If a long YouTube video earns one dollar per thousand views, then on YouTube Shorts, you need at least a lakh (100,000) views to earn that same dollar, and some people don't even earn that.  Meaning, on YouTube Shorts, you can get millions of views but no earnings at all.  However, the good thing is that views and subscribers come very quickly on YouTube Shorts.  We can leverage this to make good profits. Make the first fifteen seconds so compelling that after watching it, no one can resist watching the remaining two minutes and thirty seconds of content. Because people will watch your longer videos along with your short videos. Second, make multilingual shorts; we need to create shorts that are not only watched in India but also in other countries. Create affiliate shorts that mention apps that pay you for referrals, or affiliate products like Amazon affiliates or ClickBank products.


Now, let's talk about the last and final trick.  Well, it's not really a trick, it's a suggestion.  Earnings are not high from shorts, so create shorts that can attract more sponsorships. But how will sponsors contact you? Using these strategies, you can maximize your Shorts earnings.
