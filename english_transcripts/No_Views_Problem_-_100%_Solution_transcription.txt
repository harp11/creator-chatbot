Friends, even after consistently uploading videos to your YouTube channel, and even after creating good videos, are you getting absolutely no views?  Meaning, some videos get two views, some three, and some even fewer, meaning seriously no work is being done on them. Yet, you'll see that after uploading only four videos, in just four days, the first video has 202 views, the next 122, then 38, and 29 – the rest have almost no views. So, what mistakes are you making that are preventing views on your YouTube channel? And what have those who *are* getting views done differently?  So don't miss the end. Now let's begin.

Before starting the main part of today's video, let's understand why you're not getting views even after consistently uploading six videos. Look, if you're putting in all the effort on your end but still not getting views, the biggest reason could be that you're making some mistakes. And today, I'm going to tell you about five mistakes a brand-new YouTuber makes, which prevent views on a new channel. So let's discuss these mistakes one by one, why you're not getting views, and then we'll talk about their solutions so that you get views.

Mistake number one: You send your videos to all your contacts – your brothers, sisters, uncles, aunts, mothers, fathers, etc.  Similarly, if you have any guru, family guru, or friend's guru, let's say you have a ten-minute video and you shared the link with 100 people, and all 100 people watch your video. You'll think, "Wow, I got 100 views as soon as I uploaded the video!" But what do those 100 people do? They only watch to please you. They play the video for 10-15 seconds and then close it. In this case, the watch time retention rate of your 10-minute video becomes only 10-12 seconds. When you repeat this on your YouTube channel, YouTube thinks your video is bad and doesn't organically boost it.

Now let's talk about mistake number two. I'm not talking about anyone else; I'm talking about my relatives who recently created YouTube channels. I observed that as soon as they created their channels, they started putting every latest video on their status. Now, this isn't entirely wrong, but it has two major disadvantages.  It becomes the biggest mistake because the biggest problem is that if someone isn't interested in the content, why would they watch the video? We need to create content that attracts people, not force them to watch our videos. So, the second mistake is that if you're doing this, stop it immediately.

How to increase views and subscribers; the people who teach this often use unethical methods, which are wrong methods.  I'll tell you. I recently saw a video: "Watch my videos, and I'll watch and like yours."  This scam is happening on a massive scale.  Also, keep in mind that if someone only comes to watch your video, likes it, and comments, it takes them only 15-20 seconds, and their intention is to like and comment and leave. That 20-30 seconds will decrease your watch time retention rate, causing more harm than good. So, if you're sharing your video links in WhatsApp groups, stop doing that.

Now, mistake number four is very common. When you create a new YouTube channel, the first thing you do is check out other YouTube channels and videos to see how they're made. If you accidentally play your own video, don't stop it; watch the entire video.  Nobody can stop your views from increasing, and this is 100% working and practical. I've tried this method in different ways on my channel and my students' channels, and it works 100%.  There's only one method, and that is insights. Because, you need to upload a video, go to YouTube Analytics, and carefully observe each metric.

For example, I'll go to YT Studio and the YouTube channel of a student who created a channel. Then we'll go to "View All," and I'll go to the very bottom. The first video got 202 views. We need to pay attention to something very important here: the first video has 10 likes, the second has 5, the third has 4, and the fourth has 3. Along with this, we need to see where our first video was watched, who watched it, and for how long. If I tap here and then go to Analytics, 90 out of 202 people didn't watch my video for even 30 seconds. This means I need to improve the first 30 seconds of my video drastically.  You must make each new video better than the previous one, which means paying attention to the insights to improve your future content. Similarly, if I go to "Reach," you'll see... Along with this, we need to go to "Audience" to see where our content is being watched and who is watching it. So the 100% working method is to make every new piece of content better than the old content and carefully observe the insights of the old videos to see where you made mistakes, and then create new videos.
