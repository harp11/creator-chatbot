A completely new tab has appeared on my YouTube channel's homepage, showing videos that I neither uploaded nor have ever seen. Now, look closely at the scissor icon next to the timestamp.  Notice anything? These videos are completely different from normal videos.  If you are a YouTube video creator or want to be one, we'll learn what this feature is, how it works, how you can use it on your channel, how to expand its use, and how to avoid potential problems, all in the next two minutes, so keep watching.

But now, a new trim feature has arrived. Whenever you play a video, an icon appears below it that lets you send any part of any YouTube video. Instead of sending the entire video, you can send a short part using this feature.  The video might be ten minutes long, but your friend will see only the section you choose â€“ say, from 8 minutes to 8 minutes and 30 seconds.  It's like your subscribers have created a trailer for you, showcasing the best parts of your normal videos and attracting viewers. Click on customization, then layout, then click on the add section.  Then just tap on 'Top Community Clips'. Once you save it, it will appear on your channel's homepage.
