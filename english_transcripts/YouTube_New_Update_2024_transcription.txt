There might be an update on YouTube after which your views will explode at rocket speed, and what I'm about to tell you is a secret that very few people on YouTube know. For example, look at this channel.  It has two million subscribers, but only gets three to four thousand views. But with YouTube's new update, along with Shorts, people will also play long videos.  This means that in the coming time, long videos can also be seen in the Shorts feed, and we will get a chance to reach a new audience. The biggest advantage of this will be that those who don't get any views on long videos will now get views. Because if long videos run in short time, the earning will increase or decrease because the earning of short videos is less than long videos. Well, this is an experiment.
