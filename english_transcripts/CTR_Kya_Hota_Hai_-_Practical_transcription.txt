Friends, there are two rules for making a video viral.  First, the video's audience retention rate should be good, and second, your video's CTR should be high. CTR stands for Click-Through Rate.  And today, I'll tell you how exactly CTR is counted and what factors it depends on. You'll get the answers to all these questions in today's special Seekh episode. Also, in the last 30 seconds of the video, I'll explain everything to you in one line. First, watch this video and guess what its CTR would have been. Now, because millions of views and lakhs of likes have come on this video, people ask, "How did this video go viral?" Let me answer this question. Actually, this CTR you're seeing is the mixed CTR of all traffic sources. But to see the analytics of a video going viral, after clicking on the analytics button, you have to go to 'Reach,' and then you have to find the section where traffic sources are shown. You have to click on 'See More' there. Now you can clearly see here how many details are given: from which traffic sources you got how much traffic, how much CTR you got, how much retention rate you got, and everything else you want to see. Now, this is the main reading that I'm going to explain to you, but before that, you should know that one impression means that your video has been shown to someone once, i.e., your video's thumbnail has been shown to someone once. Now, whether they click on that thumbnail or not, but if they click on your video, YouTube's CTR means that whenever your video has been shown or ranked in YouTube search, how many times has it been clicked on 100 impressions? That is, how many views did you get from YouTube search on 100 impressions? So, the simple thing to understand is that from whichever traffic source your video brings the most CTR and watch time, YouTube will send the most impressions of your video from that source.
