Friends, do you know about Siddhant? It's a YouTube channel that, even if it uploads a video today, it would instantly trend.  Each of its videos used to get millions of views. But they, Ashish Chanchlani, haven't published any videos for the last year.  Similarly, there's a YouTube channel like WiFiStudy, with fifteen million subscribers, that hasn't uploaded a video for the last month. After eight years of YouTube experience, I'm going to tell you three solid factors that you absolutely must consider, without which you cannot become a successful YouTuber.  And the last one is the most important.  And this isn't just one, two, or three, but thousands of channels whose every other video used to trend at one time. But today, they're in such bad shape that they can't even create videos. Before creating a channel, you should know what kind of content you'll be uploading on your channel for the next five years, so that you don't have to change your content later on. Now, many creators are completely dependent on YouTube. But conversely, there are many creators who use YouTube only as a marketing tool. To explain this, I'll give you examples of three of the biggest YouTubers. The first example is Siddhant, so that they can establish a business alongside their YouTube channel. And we should learn from this that you can't make videos on YouTube for a lifetime. Therefore, as you earn from YouTube, also build your own business simultaneously. Third Factor, Dependency:  First, they created high-quality videos on YouTube and showed people that their knowledge and method of explanation was unique. That is, they completely eliminated their dependency on YouTube. And their mobile application became so stable that it no longer needs YouTube. But even then, they occasionally use YouTube to reach new audiences.
