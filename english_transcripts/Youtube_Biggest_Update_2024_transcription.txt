This year YouTube has had its biggest update yet, and it's going to change everything.  This means changes to everything from copyright rules to monetization. The biggest focus of this update is YouTube Shorts.  All the changes are centered around YouTube Shorts. When YouTube first launched Shorts, any square or vertical video under 3 minutes was counted as a Short.  Now, YouTube Shorts aren't just short videos anymore. When I first heard about this update, I was very happy. I thought that Shorts already got a lot of views and subscribers, just less watch time. And if Shorts can be 3 minutes long... Firstly, until now, you could take music from anywhere and create a Short; even copy someone's video and monetize it. Or you had to use YouTube's library.  Besides these two options, if you used music from elsewhere, your video could be demonetized or even blocked. Secondly, overall, Shorts need 10 million views in the last 90 days for monetization.  To put it simply: Now you can create Shorts up to 3 minutes long, but the format must be superior vertical.  External music isn't allowed, and the monetization criteria remain the same; no changes there. Now the question is, what to do? My suggestion is to work on this new format of Shorts. Whenever YouTube launches a new feature, it heavily boosts videos in that format.
