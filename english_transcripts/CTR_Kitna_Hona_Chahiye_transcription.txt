Today I'm going to tell you the secret of YouTube CTR that 90% of people don't know. Do you know that the CTR shown to you in YT Studio is not the actual CTR of your video? Hello guys, welcome back to Seek Official, YouTube Secrets. Now let's begin. According to a report, 400 hours of videos are uploaded on YouTube every minute. If you want to stand out among 24,000 hours of videos, your video should get more clicks than others; you need a good CTR. But what is this good CTR? What should be the minimum percentage? And here's one of my videos with an 8.2% CTR, yet it only got 7000 views.  Why are the views low despite a high CTR? Secondly, the CTR shown to us in YT Studio is not the actual CTR. To see the different CTR for each feed, you must first go to the YT Studio desktop version. Then touch Content, and then touch the video whose CTR you want to check. After that, touch Analytics and then Reach.  And CTR is not only increased by the thumbnail. It's increased by a combination of your title's starting 2-3 keywords and your thumbnail.  And there's the question of what makes a video go viral. Sometimes videos with low CTR go viral, while sometimes videos with high CTR don't. But from my expertise, having uploaded 600+ videos on YouTube, I can say this is a clear answer.  Otherwise, if you make long videos, CTR doesn't matter. If you make one-hour or two-hour videos, CTR doesn't matter at all.
