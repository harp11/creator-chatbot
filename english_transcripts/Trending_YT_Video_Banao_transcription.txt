Sir, how is this kind of YouTube content created so that the video goes viral as soon as it's made?  I mean, we don't want to wait a month, six months, or a year. We just want to make a video and have millions of views within 24 to 48 hours.  Trending topics mean content that's currently trending on social media. For example, there was a time when everyone was searching about the Blue Whale game. But if you want to know about a trend before it arrives, Google's official tool can help. I'll tell you its name in the video.  Then, we have to select our country. Since I'm from India, I'll select India. In your case, it might show Pakistan, the US, the UK, or something else.  You'll select your country.  Along with this, you'll have to tap on the filter again.  This time, you'll choose your personal category based on the kind of YouTube content you create.  You see, we have an interest-over-time graph here.  This graph shows that people watch entertainment content a lot in the morning. But if I come here, around 5:40, 7:40, the score is 64.  It's not about what people watch, but how much they watch the content we want to create. So, whatever kind of content you have in mind, you should simply search for it.  As we searched for "mujhe" (me), you'll see how much this keyword was searched on YouTube in India in the entertainment category in the last 24 hours. But friends, now comes the most important part of today's video: trending content. What content in our category is currently performing best or is about to? After tapping here, select India in the location, 24 hours in the time period, and your personal category under categories. For example, I'll select entertainment. Then, we'll move a little further. The tool's name is Google Trends. How did you like today's content?  Tell me in the feedback. Thanks for watching.
