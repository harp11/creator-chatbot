You put so much effort into making a YouTube video. Imagine someone downloading your video, re-uploading it, and making more money than you. How would that feel?  It would feel really bad, right? Hello Guys, Welcome back to Seekh Official Show YouTube Secrets, Now Let's Begin. First, go to the desktop version of YT Studio on your mobile or open YT Studio on your laptop or desktop.  Then, you'll see an icon on the left side, a "C". Click on it. This section shows you which videos have been downloaded and reused, and how many subscribers the downloader has.  For example, this channel re-uploaded my video on December 10, 2020. The channel name is shown here, with 18,400 subscribers. And here you see that 100% of my video has been copied and pasted. As you can see, I have a complete list of which videos have been reused and re-uploaded by others.  I have many such videos. Then, you'll see the complete details of the video, like your video's URL, the other person's video URL, and the URL of the channel that copied the video.  Above, you'll see three options. If you tap the second icon, a video removal request form will appear. You can add videos there and then submit the form. Your email address will be included, and an email will be sent to the other party, allowing you to communicate. So friends, let me know in the feedback what new things you learned in this whole process.
