To make a book summary video, you use a book for help, and to make a news article video, you use a news article. But think, after making videos on them, how can we avoid copyright strike, especially when we have to make a book summary video?  If we make a video, we'll take someone's help, right?  If the content we take help from gets a copyright strike, then what will happen to us?  Hello friends, I am Havas Singh, and welcome to Seek Official Trip Secrets. Let's learn something new today. First, let's talk about book summaries.  If you've done a word-to-word copy, everything matches, and you're repeating the same thing or showing a screenshot of the book on the board and teaching from it, how can we avoid this? If you teach by only changing the numbers or digits of the same sentences, there won't be any problem. Similarly, there's a book, "Rich Dad Poor Dad." If you read the book once and explain it word-by-word, mentioning what's in the book, what's in this chapter, what's in that chapter, then you could face a copyright strike. This means we shouldn't use any content word-for-word.  Similarly, let's talk about news articles. If you read any news article and directly copy its text, then...if you want to use any news article in your videos, how can you do it?  See, the best way is to carefully read the news article.  See what's written on this website, then include it.  Actually, they'll also benefit because you're promoting their website. There won't be any problem. If you have any doubts on this topic, you can tell me in the feedback. If I find your concern valuable, I will make a dedicated episode on this topic.
