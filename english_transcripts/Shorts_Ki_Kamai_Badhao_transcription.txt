There are two YouTube channels. Both create shorts, both have the same content, and both receive the same number of views. However, one earns ₹10,000 per month, while the other earns ₹1,000,000 per month.  In this 30-second video, I'll show you the best and easiest use of this feature, which you absolutely cannot ignore. So don't miss this.  From one video, I earned ₹8, and from 50,000 videos, I earned ₹30.  And man, at this rate, even if millions watch each short video...  Let's first understand what this new feature is and how it works.  Friends, in any short where you want to use this new feature, just tap on its edit button. After finding the product, you'll need to tap on this plus button.  After that, as soon as someone watches your video and purchases this product, you will receive its affiliate commission. Wait, wait, wait. Let's say I searched for a microphone here and selected a One Dynamic microphone, which costs only ₹2,590. Just imagine, here I'm getting a commission of only 6.2%, which is clearly written here. Think about that, and that's from just one short video! Now, we've assumed only a 1% conversion rate. But even if the conversion rate fluctuates a bit, the earnings from one short are not at all low. You need to start a dedicated YouTube channel within each niche, and then work on it back-to-back. If you build up your YouTube channel in any category, and if you earn all the money here, then you have to remove your link from this place and put the link in the video description – your affiliate link, whether it's Flipkart's or Myntra's.
