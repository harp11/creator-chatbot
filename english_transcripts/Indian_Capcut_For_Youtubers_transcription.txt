Forget using CapCut with a VPN, because CapCut is now on the Play Store. No, I don't believe it. Now it will play, right buddy? Hey brother, listen to the whole thing. This app also has some features that weren't even in CapCut. And along with that, whatever editing is trending on Instagram, you have all those features on your homepage that an editor uses repeatedly. Like, by touching "Great," you can start working on a new project.  Along with that, this app will transcribe your entire video, i.e., convert it into text, remove unnecessary parts, and keep only the best takes. And all this is going to happen with AI help. After that, by touching "Auto Captions," you can generate captions in more than 50 languages in your video, like me.  This makes it one of the best video editors for YouTubers.  This is all normal, man, but now I'll tell you about some features of this app that make it the king of editing apps. This app is so stable that it exports any project, no matter how heavy, very easily without any errors. Importing and editing data in this app is so fast that CapCut and VPN are not even close. And because of all these features, this app becomes the Indian CapCut for YouTubers, just its name is a little different.
