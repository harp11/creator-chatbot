Friends, we uploaded the same video to two different YouTube channels. One is an eight-year-old channel with 270,000 subscribers, and the other is a brand-new channel with 400-500 subscribers.  We expected more views on the older channel, but the opposite happened. The newer channel with only 400 subscribers received significantly more views.

First, let's understand if YouTube really does help new channels grow faster.  You can see here: 34,000, 4,000, 12,000 views â€“ and all traffic is organic. We didn't run any ads or share the video anywhere. YouTube itself gave us this traffic.

YouTube says that new channels and new talents get a boost when competing with established YouTubers.  They claim that if a YouTuber starts creating videos on the platform, they'll receive a slightly bigger boost compared to older channels.

To put it simply: yes, it's 100% true that YouTube promotes new channels faster.  This doesn't mean that only channels created yesterday are considered new.

Now, let's discuss how to grow an older channel. My channel is also old. I go to Analytics, then Back, and here's the dashboard. If you look here, you'll see that our channel receives boosts if we consistently work on it.  It's my personal experience that if you believe YouTube wants good creators on their platform, and if you create good content, you will grow 100%.  You don't necessarily have to compete with older YouTubers; YouTube might give you a slight advantage, but ultimately, your content must be good, your video quality high, you need consistency, and your content should be competitive.

If you pay attention to these points, nothing can stop your channel from growing.
