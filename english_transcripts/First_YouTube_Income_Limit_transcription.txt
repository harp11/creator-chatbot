You will create good content, you will also complete 1000 subscribers, after completing 4000 hours of watch time, you will also monetize your channel, but do you know when your first income starts? Let's learn something new today.  See, we all know that when our YouTube channel gets 1000 subscribers and 4000 hours of watch time, we have to create an AdSense account. We also have to connect our bank account to AdSense, for which a special code is required, which is called a SWIFT code. Now, this SWIFT code is a very normal thing. Now see, there is a whole process for YouTube money to come into your bank account, which you should know. Suppose you have earned three dollars, it will keep adding up. But as soon as the 12th of the month comes, between the 10th and 12th, YouTube updates your month's earnings to AdSense. Now you simply understand that if you have earned a total of â‚¹10,000 from July 1st to July 31st, and this money will be updated in your AdSense account on the 12th of August, but you will receive that money from the 22nd to the 27th. And now we tell you how much the first payment is. As soon as 100 dollars are completed in your account, your first payment arrives. And by the way, if your account has 100 dollars before the 12th of the first month, you can get it earlier by creating good content. Thanks for watching.
