Friends, until I get a "All Checks Completed" notification on my phone, I cannot live stream my YouTube videos. If I do so, my video may get a yellow dollar sign (indicating a monetization issue).  Because whenever you upload a YouTube video, several checks are displayed: details, ad suitability, video elements, copyright checks, and visibility. Let's learn something today. First, let's understand the meaning of the notification I showed you all at the beginning. If I swipe down, you'll see here, "All Checks Completed." This means... Now let's understand what these checks are and how they work. Whenever you upload a video to YouTube, YouTube's processing system checks if your video has been uploaded to YouTube before, and if your video contains any copyrighted elements.  Simultaneously, when you tap on "Ad Suitability," you're asked various kinds of questions. Now, if you think your video contains any of this content, simply tap on it, then tick the type of content it is. And if it doesn't contain any of this content, then go to "Checks." You will see that we first need to submit the review. Now look, it clearly says in "Checks," "No issues found" under copyright. Even after this, we shouldn't directly publish our video. Because if you publish directly, even after one or two hours of the video being uploaded, sometimes I see strikes. So what should we do? If our video contains content that violates YouTube's guidelines, YouTube will take down the video during processing itself, and our video will be deleted after going live in front of our audience. From today onwards, if you upload a video to YouTube, first upload the video, wait some time, and after waiting 3-4 hours, publish your video.
