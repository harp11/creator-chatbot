Friends, nowadays AI has become so advanced that it can do almost everything—scripting, shooting, editing, and even video upload SEO.  It does it so cleanly, even better than we can. But have you ever thought, if you want to earn money from YouTube, should you focus on AI channels or non-AI channels? Which type of channel will grow more in the future, and which will earn more? Today's first question is, should we focus on AI channels? Friends, the answer is straightforward: absolutely yes. Whenever a new technology arrives, YouTube and the audience support it greatly. And using AI, you can generate content at a very high speed. From tips to voiceovers, shooting, editing—AI will do everything. You just need to review the final content and upload it to YouTube.  After that, today's second question is, which types of channels will grow more in the future? Friends, the answer to this question is that only those channels will succeed whose content is unique and good, and which can crack the competition. Because in the coming time, it will become difficult to even distinguish between AI and non-AI content. The editing has been done using Filmora's AI editing tools, subtitles have been written using BlinkCaptions, and finally, some minor corrections have been done by a video editor. So think about it, YouTube has given an Inspiration tab in its YT Studio, in which AI is used.  On the video upload page, there is a separate section for Altered Content so that we can tell YouTube whether our content is AI-generated or not.  Meaning, YouTube is fully supporting AI generation. Therefore, be assured, YouTube will not demonetize AI channels.
