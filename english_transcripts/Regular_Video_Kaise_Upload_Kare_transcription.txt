Friends, we all know that if we consistently upload videos to our YouTube channel daily, on alternate days, or once a week, and remain consistent, our channel will grow 100%.  YouTube itself says this. And if you're also someone who works on YouTube but can't maintain consistency, in the next four to five minutes I'm going to tell you something after which you too will be able to upload YouTube videos consistently at 100%. And I've learned some things here, that if you understand them, nothing can stop your growth. Hello Guys, Welcome to Sikh Official Show, YouTube Secrets. Now, Let's Begin. This is our team's channel, which we started recently. You can see the videos here. And this is the main reason we haven't shared our YouTube channel anywhere until now. But we've had 6.5 thousand views in the last 28 days. And the 489 subscribers here are also 100% organic.

Tip number one: Set realistic goals. Don't think, "I'm going to take a 90-day challenge, and within those 90 days I have to upload two videos per day and do a live stream every week, along with daily uploads."  Secondly, you have to set realistic goals. Let's say you think you can upload 30 videos in a month; think about uploading only 15 videos. You can create content for the rest of the month and the coming days, and then if you want, you can upload videos daily – no problem. People start challenges, but they don't have any ideas, no preparation, and no content planning – no plan for what videos they're going to upload. Now, because I've already made an episode on content planning, I prepare what videos I'll make in the next 90 days and their thumbnails beforehand. And after that, the only work left is to make the video, upload it, and I have no more work left. Now I don't know what kind of videos you make, but keep in mind that however long your challenge is, you should have that much content planned beforehand. I'm not saying do content research. Like when we started uploading videos, sometimes we'd get one view, sometimes two, sometimes three, or sometimes ten – we never got more than ten views. And seeing that, we'd get demotivated within ten or twelve days.  Whoever takes a 90-day challenge or a 30-day challenge shouldn't get demotivated at all until it's complete. Because here, we're not concerned with frequency, we're not concerned with growth. Now, if you are also a YouTube video creator and your channel isn't growing and you think you can't stay consistent, then take a challenge with me right now – one that you can handle – and then you'll see the magic you can't even imagine. Your channel will grow.
