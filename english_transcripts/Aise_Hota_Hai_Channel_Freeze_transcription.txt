Friends, even after creating good, high-quality videos on your YouTube channel and doing excellent video editing, are your views and subscribers not increasing at all? Today I'm not talking about anyone else, but about my own YouTube channel, Comfort Earning. Three years ago, I started using Understanding Insights. That means going into my YT Studio and checking my Best Performing Top 15 videos in the last 48 hours. This helps me see which topics and needs the maximum number of videos are related to, and this tells me what kind of videos I should make to get instant views.

Step 2: Reels vs. Shorts. In the second step, I need to see whether my channel has more views on Shorts videos or long videos in the last 28 days.

Step 3: Emotional Story Videos. This step is very important. Why? Let me explain.  Since I'm reactivating this channel after three years, most of my subscribers have probably forgotten my face. However, some subscribers remain, and if you apologize to them for your absence, they often become active subscribers again. This requires much less effort than getting new subscribers.

Step 4: Content Planning. Three years ago, I used to create content haphazardly.  Converting returning viewers into active subscribers is much easier, and that's our target.

Step 5: The most important step â€“ Unique Action. This will be the only step, and if we do it, people will love it.

Now, to reactivate my channel, I'm taking a 30-day challenge from April 8th to May 8th.  One video every day, covering a complete YouTube course from basic to advanced. I'll also check their channels and point out their mistakes and how they can improve. Following all these steps will ensure the reactivation of this channel. You can check this channel's performance on my channel.
