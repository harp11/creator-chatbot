This is our team's brand new channel, on which we have uploaded only seventeen videos, and this channel has already received forty thousand impressions. Now, if you are also a YouTuber and you don't know what YouTube impressions are, how they work, and how they are increased, then the next 2 minutes can be life-changing for you. Now, in the next 2 minutes, you have to concentrate and listen carefully to what I'm saying; otherwise, you won't understand anything.  You must have heard the saying, "first impression is the last impression." It's the same on YouTube. When you upload a video to YouTube, if a user clicks on your thumbnail in that first impression and watches your entire video, then YouTube considers your video a good video. In this entire process, I will tell you one thing: first impression is the last impression. After that, to test the quality of your video, YouTube shows your single video at the same time in YouTube search, browse feature, suggestions, short feed, and related feed.  In simple language, I upload mixed content on my channel, so my subscribers watch my videos very little. Therefore, all the traffic on my channel comes from YouTube search because my videos are good. And if you create content that performs well on YouTube search, YouTube suggestions, browse feature, short feed, everywhere, then you can get unlimited impressions on YouTube. I don't think you will have any doubts left in your mind about YouTube impressions now.
