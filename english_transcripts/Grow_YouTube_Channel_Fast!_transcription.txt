Friends, today I've brought a trick for all of you that I haven't shared on Seekho app until today, which will grow your YouTube channel very fast. The good thing about this trick is... before starting today's video, you need to understand how YouTube figures out the topic of your video. Because if you understand this math, then nothing can stop your channel from growing. YouTube identifies what your video is about from the keywords you repeatedly speak in your video transcription. And when YouTube understands the topic of your video, it shows your content to the audience that is extremely interested in seeing your content.  And without falling prey to this experiment, your channel won't grow. So now the question arises, sir, if this is the case, what is the solution? So my friend, now listen very carefully so that YouTube instantly understands your topic during transcription.  2. You shouldn't write just one keyword in your title, one title, but rather write a highly engaging title in the beginning that people will see and click on. But be sure to use this symbol (presumably a separator like a pipe "|" or a comma ",") between each keyword. So that all keywords are counted separately from each other, and according to your content, YouTube can reach your content to the right people.
