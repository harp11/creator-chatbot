Friends, do you also want 100% corporate-free music, sound effects, and that too absolutely free?  Then there's no need to go to any third-party website, and no need to mention any channel or any artist in the description. Because YouTube itself has created a special library for all creators. Its name is YouTube Audio Library, and it's so advanced that even premium audio providers fail in comparison.  New music and sound effects are added here regularly, and you can choose any track, however you like, whichever you like. But, but, but there's a mistake you absolutely shouldn't make, otherwise, a copyright claim might come on your video. We'll learn about that in the next 30 seconds of this episode. Then, after that, YouTube's audio library will appear before you. Now look, it's very easy to see;  meanwhile, whatever music or sound effect you need, touch it. First, I'll touch music. Then, multiple music tracks appear before me. But how do I know which one is new, which one was just added, and which one is very old? Here, the latest added music tracks will be shown. And if I touch it again here, then the old tracks will be shown first, and the new tracks later. Then, if I want short music... Now, this is about these two filters, but now suppose I need a song of a particular mood or a music track, what will I do? Then I'll just touch here on search, then on mood, and then you can pick music here according to your needs. But friends, now let's talk about that mistake which you should absolutely not make, which are attributes. Now look, YouTube's logo is shown in front of some music, and CC in front of some. What is this? To use CC tracks, you will have to mention the music artist in the video description. You have to give credit, whose details you will get after clicking on this particular button. We will meet again tomorrow in the next episode. Until then, watch and learn.
