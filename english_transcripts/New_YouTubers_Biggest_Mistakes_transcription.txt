If you are a new YouTuber or are about to start YouTube, I will tell you five mistakes that every new YouTuber makes. And if you don't make these mistakes in the beginning, you can get far ahead of the competition.  Hello guys, welcome back to Seekh Official Show, YouTube Secrets, now let's begin.

The first mistake: People start uploading videos directly on YouTube without gaining complete knowledge.  I meet many people who say...so let me tell you, before starting YouTube, gain knowledge about everything.

Second: Unprofessional page.  Many people create channels on YouTube, and their thumbnails and themes are different in every video. Because of this, their entire YouTube channel looks disorganized. So here are some tips to make your page look very professional. Second, if you go to my YouTube channel, and go to the playlists, you'll see that I have created separate playlists for each category. Start working on creating specific playlists so that your audience can easily watch videos of the type they want to see â€“ today, a year from now, or two years from now.

Third mistake:  Another mistake people make is, "This content is doing well, let me make this," and they say that the video is from six months or a year ago. You have to think about what's currently trending, and keep certain factors in mind. Now, the combination of these three things is a perfect essay, which new YouTubers completely don't use. Now, watch a popular YouTuber's video. We have made a separate episode on this, which you can watch on Seekh, in YouTube Secrets.

Last and final: The biggest mistake, guys. We've made a dedicated episode on its reality, but I'll briefly explain.  In terms of monetization, both your subscribers and watch time are important. In fact, there's a negative impact if people aren't watching your videos.

So in this entire episode, I want to say one thing: New YouTubers, avoid these five mistakes at all costs.
