It's common knowledge that if we create trending videos, we'll get more views than usual, reaching a significant number of new viewers within the first 48 hours.  However, the problem is that we don't know which content or keywords are currently trending.  If we knew this, we could create videos that would start getting views on our channel within 48 hours. Don't skip a single part! Hello Guys, Welcome to Seekho Official Show YouTube Secrets, Now Let's Begin.

So, first, go to Google.com. After arriving here, search for only one keyword: "Google Keyword Planner."  This tool is used by those who run ads on videos. You know those ads that appear before videos? They're managed from here. But this tool also shows which content is currently receiving high traffic.  So, simply visit the Keyword Planner. After going there, this interface will appear. We simply need to do nine things.  The computer version works better. Press enter and add a keyword. You can add up to ten keywords here according to your channel.  I'll add 3-4 keywords relevant to my channel. We need to go to the top and tap on "Average monthly searches." Now, look below. You'll see that "Work From Home" has one to a million searches.  Any content showing 10,000 to a million or even ten million searches means that content is trending. If you make a video on it, you'll get more views than usual. Now decide what kind of channel you have.

You'll search on Google for "Google Trends." When you search, Google's website will appear.  If you want to see what's currently trending on the internet, not based on a specific keyword, but the most viral sensations, simply tap the three bars. For example, "SSC Results 2024 Maharashtra Board." If you have a news channel or a channel about government results, you could make a video on this topic. If you go to "Real-time," it will show you what's currently trending.  It shows India's past history—which keywords were searched previously, how many people are searching now, and which Indian region is searching the most.

Now, let's talk about the third tool, which you all know: YouTube Studio's Analytics, then the Research tool.  After arriving here, search for any keyword.  As we search, you'll see searches on YouTube. You can see various keywords that are currently being searched the most on YouTube. There's also high volume and low volume. If you make videos on high-volume keywords, we can tell you with 100% accuracy what's currently trending in the market.

And the last platform is X—not that X, but Twitter. If you observe Twitter carefully...
