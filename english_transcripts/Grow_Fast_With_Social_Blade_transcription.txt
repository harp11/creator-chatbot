Friends, imagine a website, Social Blade, so powerful that it helps you uncover the secrets of any YouTube channel's growth.  Social Blade is designed for those who want to grow on YouTube, overcome competition, and utilize advanced strategies. Before I tell you anything else, let's understand what this website does, its pros and cons.  Not only that, friends, you can also get the "kundali" (astrological chart – here meaning detailed insights) of any YouTube channel.  "Kundali" means insights – how much a channel is growing, how many views it's getting, how many subscribers it's gaining daily, and other information that other tools or websites don't provide. Now, let's talk about how to get a channel's "kundali." Whether it's your competitor or your inspiration, the channel you want to study, just enter its name here.  Not only that, in the YouTube stats summary, you can also see how many daily views the channel is getting. By touching "Top" in the top list, you can get the list of top 50, top 100, top 500 channels, study them, and learn how they're working, which you should also do to help yourself.  To do this, by touching "Compare" shown at the top, you can compare any three channels, including your channel with your competitors.
