Friends, you may not have noticed this, but whenever you upload a YouTube video, you get an option to choose a category for it. I've done thorough research for all of you and created a list of what kind of videos should be uploaded in which category, with examples so you can relate 100%.

Next, we have auto and vehicles, and again here too, it's clear what kind of content should be there.  For the Music category, many people wonder, "I'm making a cover song, which category should I upload it to?"  It clearly states: whether you're making a cover song, an original song, a company's song, or any kind of song, if it has lyrics, it goes in the song category. Now, what are the benefits? Your song will get a separate music label, and your song will also be considered on the YouTube Music app.

Here, you'll create content where you're giving information about a pet, an animal, its care tips, how to care for it, etc. Or if you make funny videos, with the intention of making someone laugh, it will go into the comedy video category.  Then there's How-to & Style. Many times, you make fashion vlogs or styling videos.

Then we talk about Science and Technology. If you create content about science, technology, or new innovations – for example, Chandrayaan 3 – then that content should go into Science and Technology. For example, Linus Tech Tips.

Next comes travel.  In travel, we'll put videos where we go somewhere and give information about it, give travel guides, or itineraries. All these videos will go into the travel category.

Then comes education.  Tutorials also fall here, but we shouldn't get confused. Education, in this sense, means academic coaching. This includes content about history, math, science, etc.

Then comes News and Politics. This content includes current affairs, recent issues, or news related to politics.  For example, BBC News or Aaj Tak.

If you're doing a podcast, an interview, or creating something entertaining that makes someone spend a long time on YouTube, sharing current issues, or creating content that makes someone aware of something, that content will come under this category.

Now let's talk about sports.  Any content like cricket, badminton, football videos, or tips and tricks will go into the sports category.

Finally, people & blogs.  This includes daily updates about one's life, the world, etc. If your content is different from what we've discussed, it will go here.

The biggest advantage of choosing the correct category is that we can quickly reach the right audience. YouTube is helped in getting our videos to the right audience.
