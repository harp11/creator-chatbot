Want to earn from YouTube but can't show your face? Today I'm going to tell you not one, not two, but many different YouTube channel ideas where you'll see amazing earnings. It's possible your YouTube channel could even be monetized within a month, and you'll start earning money.  Greetings friends, I'm Hawasing, and welcome to Seek Official Show YouTube Secrets.

The first channel idea on our list is funny video comment reviews. What is this? Whenever you're watching a reel on Instagram, and a funny video comes up, have you ever wanted to comment on it?  Many people feel this way. When we search for this content on YouTube, you'll see very limited people have made videos on this content. Basically, what we have to do with this type of content is… from Instagram, find any top 5… you don't even need to do much content research to make a video. You just have to find five Reels or five YouTube Shorts, and playing that 10-second Reel, you can review its comments for 30 seconds. When you search for this kind of YouTube channel on YouTube, you'll find channels that were recently created and have grown rapidly.  Now, this channel was created by me; it's my friend's channel. You can see it here. It's "Top 5 Best Category." In this, you can pick any micro-niche and start creating content on it, whether it's the gift category or a mobile category. We created this three years ago, and the funny thing is that Madamji didn't work consistently.  But when you make videos like Top 5, Top 3, you give affiliate links within the video description, and through your videos, you can earn quite a good amount of money from Google Adsense as well as affiliate marketing.

So, our second category is Top 3, Top 5 YouTube channels where you can create any content that interests you. After that, the third category is DIY channels for housewives. These are videos on how a woman can learn to sew at home. Now, the content is very normal; you can see the thumbnails, but look at their views: 41,000, 30,000, 48,000. They get amazing views, and there's always a lingering question of "What should we do? What should we do?" And because of this, if they watch one of your videos, they become your regular visitors. Five-minute art and craft is also such a YouTube channel.

The fourth channel idea we have is the most explosive: an AI tools channel. Now, people have made many videos on AI, and all of them have millions of views. Second thing, since new AI tools are constantly emerging, if you create an AI channel, you'll find many sponsors. Look, you don't have to do anything here; you have to make ASMR videos. For example, you take a samosa, but it's very crispy. I mean, if anyone takes a bite, it makes an amazing sound. And this type of YouTube channel is also very trending today. Along with this, you can also make ASMR videos. Now, if you research them, you'll find out.
