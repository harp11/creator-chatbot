Friends, do you want to create professional YouTube thumbnails but don't have a laptop or a high-end PC? You can create amazing thumbnails using your mobile phone. First, open the Canva app. Click the plus icon, then select "YouTube thumbnail." A 1280 x 720 pixel page will open. I'll show you everything from scratch. To do that, let's close this page. Simply swipe down, and you'll get a blank page.  Search for "background" here; you'll need to go to the photo section. You'll find many backgrounds. Let me pick one. I have many photos; you can import your own.  As soon as I touch it, the background will be removed in one click.  The photo's background is completely removed, but the skin tone and overall quality aren't very good, even in the free version.  If you tap the "up" button, it will start detecting the face and smoothing it in seconds.  Since I'm talking about money, I'll go to "Elements," then "Graphics," and search for "money."  I'll go to the last option, positioning, and bring it to the back.  See, the photo is now behind the background. But our yellow background is completely gone. To retain it, we'll reduce the opacity of the money layer. We'll adjust the transparency so both the background and photo are visible. This effect looks good. Next, we'll add text. Simply touch "text," then "add a heading." I've chosen a font, clicked "done," and positioned it. I've added the elements I want.  See, it took me about 3-4 minutes, but I've manipulated the text and background so everything is clearly visible. You can search for and replace anything according to your theme. I used a money image and added it. I'll go to the "Elements" tab, then "Upload," and import a payment screenshot. This thumbnail is almost ready.  The quality depends on your practice and ideas.
