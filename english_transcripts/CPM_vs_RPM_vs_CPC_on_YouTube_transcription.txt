It's common knowledge that how much money you earn from YouTube depends on the CPM and RPM shown in the Revenue tab.  The higher the CPM and RPM, the higher the earnings. But what do CPM and RPM depend on? Hello guys, welcome back to Seekh Official Show YouTube Secrets. Now let's begin.

First, let's understand the difference between CPM and RPM in a very short way, because until you understand the difference, you won't understand CPC. CPM stands for Cost Per Mille (or Cost Per Thousand). This means how much money advertisers are spending to show 1000 ads on your videos. RPM stands for Revenue Per Mille (or Revenue Per Thousand). This means how much money YouTube (through Google AdSense) will pay you for 1000 views, which will come to your bank account.  You might be thinking that the money advertisers spend goes directly to us. That's completely wrong! Because if YouTube did that, how would YouTube make money?

So, from the earnings generated by advertisements on your videos, YouTube keeps 45% and gives you the remaining 55%.  This is the reason why YouTube's RPM and CPM are different from each other and are always fluctuating. YouTube also offers you the option to earn through features like memberships, Super Chat, Super Stickers, and YouTube Premium, which significantly boost earnings.  So far, we've understood that YouTube earnings completely depend on CPM and RPM. But now let's talk about what these two depend on.  First, they depend on CPC, which stands for Cost Per Click.  This refers to how much money Seekho Google Ads spends to get one ad clicked. Now, obviously, the higher the CPC, the higher the CPM and the higher the RPM. Now, focus on this point â€“  try to keep your CPC rate high to get ahead of others. And if our video title is related to a high CPC brand, then ads from that brand will appear on our video, and our earnings will be higher.
