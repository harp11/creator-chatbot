Short videos grow quickly on YouTube, but getting views on long videos initially is very difficult.  Everyone keeps saying, "Make shorts! Make shorts!"  Yet, some people say that shorts earn less, and there's a huge difference in earnings between the two. I don't beat around the bush and get straight to the point. These are two of my videos with similar views; one is a long video, and one is a short video. Their earnings are much lower than mine. Now you'll say, "Sir, this means we shouldn't make short videos," right? But no.  Long videos can earn similarly because their CPM (Cost Per Mille) is usually higher. Or think of it this way: earnings in some foreign countries are much higher than in India.  Also, earnings aren't just from ads. You all know about sponsorships, but what about labeling? Let me explain.  In labeling, a brand like XYG will approach you and say, "[Do this]", and for doing so, they'll pay you three to four thousand rupees per video. This is because they are also marketing themselves.  The channel is yours, the ad revenue is yours, but the logo belongs to someone else.  However, since millions of views on every long video aren't possible, you won't see this option as frequently as you do with shorts.  Even after knowing all this, if you're confused about whether long videos or short videos earn more, the simple answer is: if you're not earning from YouTube yet – whether you're making shorts or long videos – at least try! Secondly, earnings in both depend on how many views you get. But there's a major difference. How did you like today's content?  Let me know in the feedback. Thanks for watching.
