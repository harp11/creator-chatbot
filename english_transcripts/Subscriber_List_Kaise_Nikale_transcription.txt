Friends, do you know that you can also find out who subscribed to your channel when and how many subscribers that subscriber has?  I'm not kidding, I'm going to show you all this live with proof. Now, because some people have trouble running the desktop version of YT Studio on mobile, let me explain it step-by-step in a very short way.  Then you have to go to the dashboard shown on the right side, and there YT Studio will appear in front of you. Now zoom in a little on the dashboard, then your tab will be shown, which is Recent Subscribers. This tab doesn't just have that; it has many more interesting features that you need to know. If you tap on the subscriber arrow here, you will first see those people who have a lot of subscribers. And if you go all the way down and tap on the unit, change ten to fifty, just tap on this tab and tap on Lifetime there. After that, you can see that people who themselves have millions of subscribers have also subscribed to my channel.
