Every new and old YouTuber has a feature called AVD in their YT Studio.  This feature determines how much watch time your channel gets for a given number of views. What is AVD, how can we increase it, and how can we quickly achieve 4000 hours of watch time on our channel? We'll find out in the next 4 minutes. First, we need to understand what 4000 hours actually means. 4000 hours equals 240,000 minutes, and 240,000 minutes equals 144,000,000 seconds.  But we understand that we need 240,000 minutes to monetize our channel. So, for this entire process, you need to know your channel's AVD. We have to tap on videos, and after tapping, you'll slide, slide again, slide again. Here's the average view duration, which is 2 minutes and 18 seconds for me. Now, what do new YouTubers do? They make short videos, two minutes, three minutes, and they think that if their video goes viral, their channel will become viral with just one video. Now we'll talk about how to increase AVD, but first, let's understand a calculation. Now, how can you increase this AVD? It has a very simple formula: make videos as long as possible. Then, make the content so engaging that people watch your videos as much as possible. The more they watch, the better. You have to make all your videos long so that the AVD of each video is very high, and your overall channel AVD (Average View Duration), which I just showed you, also increases. And YouTube's algorithm also boosts longer videos. Now, check your channel's AVD and tell me what your channel's AVD is. I will check out everyone's in the feedback.
