Friends, when we create a new YouTube channel, the biggest problem is: we make one or two videos, but how do we consistently create videos?  We can't maintain consistency.  However, if the content for the next month is scheduled after creating the title, thumbnail, and SEO, then you'll see in their dashboard that their latest videos are starting to get good views because of the consistent content posting.  To help your YouTube channel grow super fast, today's episode is specially made for you. In today's episode, we'll talk about five different things.  First, we'll learn how to create scripts for 90 YouTube Shorts in under an hour. Second, we'll learn how to do text-to-speech conversion 100% free, using AI, that sounds completely natural and professional. These are not available on websites like Mixkit. And yes, don't miss the latter part of today's video because there I've shown you all the secret ChatGPT prompts we'll be using in today's video.  These prompts can be used for motivational content (just write the script, add visuals, and your video is ready). Third, horror story YouTube channels grow very fast. You can see here that a video using only photos and AI voice has already received 3 million likes, meaning at least 30 million views.  Just take the visuals you need and add them here, and your video is ready.  Fourth, my favorite category is Finance Management or Personal Finance. The 90 topics can be found in just one minute if you know this secret ChatGPT prompt, which is revealed at the end of today's episode.  When you enter this secret prompt into ChatGPT, it will think in a very advanced way. But remember to use ChatGPT's O3, the latest mini model. It will properly reason and think deeply about your questions and give you 100% working titles. To do this, we'll first select our title, copy it, and then come to ChatGPT and give it the prompt revealed at the end of the episode. When you give this prompt, you'll get a 100% engaging script on that topic, which will be very powerful and can be used to generate a natural voice. Remember, we have to use ChatGPT's O3 Mini Model only, because ChatGPT's O1 model provides very limited responses for free. Here, we need a tool that can convert our script into voice, but that voice should be natural. For 90 Shorts, you don't need many, just 5-6 different Gmail IDs. You can use them to log into 11 Labs repeatedly and generate voices for free through different accounts. Once you have 90 titles, 90 scripts, and 90 audios, you will go to this website called Pictory.  It has a very solid collection of visuals. After this process, everything becomes very simple and basic.  Literally, if you pay attention to everything I've said, you can generate 90 Shorts in just 12-14 hours, but yes, you will have to work a little harder. Please let me know in the feedback which videos you liked the most. Thanks for watching.
