Hello Creators, YouTube recently made a huge update to its algorithm, and YouTube itself announced it so we can all benefit.  However, many people are still unaware of this update.  It's really a three-minute YouTube Short, and honestly, I personally like the update a lot. But the problematic thing is that whenever you upload a short to YouTube, you'll have a three-minute time limit.  Simultaneously, this also becomes an issue: will earnings decrease or increase after this new format?  [The repeated "YouTube par YouTube par..." is filler and can be ignored]. Now, viewers prefer short-form vertical content over long-form horizontal content. Therefore, YouTube took this step so that creators can quickly create their long-form content in a vertical format. It's also possible that YouTube took this step inspired by TikTok.

Q2. What are the benefits for us?  The straightforward answer is: Low Competition, High Reach. Remember when YouTube Shorts was newly launched? Even basic shorts went viral because YouTube was heavily promoting its new format.  There are still relatively few creators using it. YouTube will promote this, and you can leverage it to boost your channel.

Q3. Will the watch time from these new three-minute shorts count towards monetization or not?  We've researched this, and it seems YouTube will treat this format entirely like YouTube Shorts.  That means the watch time from this format will not count towards monetization.  (Note:  The parenthetical statement about needing 10 million views in 90 days for monetization is unrelated to this question, and appears to be an aside.)

Question no. 4:  What you've all been waiting for: How do we create and upload these new-format YouTube Shorts so our videos appear in the YouTube Shorts feed? Will earnings be lower or higher with this new format?  YouTube hasn't fully rolled out this new feature yet, but you can start using it. YouTube says any vertical, square video under three minutes will be counted as a short.  So, it's possible your short might not appear in the Shorts feed for 10-12 days after uploading. But as YouTube rolls out the update, your videos will start appearing in the Shorts feed.
