Yesterday, a friend asked me, "Brother, whenever you upload a video, it instantly ranks on the first page of YouTube.  When we upload videos, it doesn't happen." I told him some tricks, and now all of his videos are also ranking on YouTube after uploading. First, let's talk about the basics. For a while, you need to come out of your imagination and understand that not all videos can rank on YouTube. Some specific videos don't get traffic from YouTube search, but from the browse feature – meaning from the YouTube homepage or suggestions, or that section of YouTube shown on the side when a video is playing. We'll talk about the browse feature and suggestions later, but today let's talk about YouTube search.  You can't rank specific content like daily vlogs, or content that people on YouTube don't directly search for but only watch when it's in front of them. If you forcefully try to do this, your views will decrease even further. So, the question arises: which videos can be ranked? Well, the simple answer is videos that people prefer to watch directly by searching on YouTube – like tutorials, technology, news, education.  The simple funda of YouTube search is that when a video is uploaded, it starts ranking on related keywords instantly. Initially, YouTube shows new uploads to very few people. You might not know this, but all big YouTubers get sent the latest smartphones 10-12 days before their launch. And as soon as the phone launches, they all simultaneously produce the same video on the same phone within a minute or two of each other. Now, everyone will have made a good video, a good thumbnail. In this whole process, imagine thousands of people uploading thousands of videos on the same topic. There are some best practices for ranking any video. Now, the YouTube algorithm is so advanced that without video text, without video description, the first 4-5 words of the title should be clickable, the next 4-5 words searchable, and the last 3-4 words should include your channel name or playlist name so that clicks on the content are also good. Along with this, our thumbnail should be completely relevant to our title and content, similar, so that the viewer doesn't feel it's misleading.
