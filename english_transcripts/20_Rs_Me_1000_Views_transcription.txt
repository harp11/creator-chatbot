Friends, today I'm going to tell you a YouTube secret that nobody on YouTube will tell you. Because if anyone tries to tell you, YouTube will delete their video. In fact, you've also seen many times that some people come to the market saying, "Sir, give us 2000 rupees, we'll monetize your YouTube channel," "Sir, give us 500 rupees, we'll do this work for you." So how does all this work? Have you ever wondered about this? First of all, today I'll tell you how all this works in the backend. Secondly, I'll tell you how you can buy views and subscribers at the least cost and in the least time, and that too in a 100% legal way. And friends, if you are a content creator, it is very important for you to watch this episode till the end so that you don't make the mistakes that many creators make and then later regret their channel's downfall. First, let's understand in just one minute how all this works. See, if you buy any views and subscribers on YouTube, you have two different methods.  We'll talk a little more about which one you should use later. But before that, let's understand that when we buy views and subscribers from these websites, we're essentially buying watch time.  Sir, please get 1000 subscribers and 4000 hours of watch time on my YouTube channel. I'll pay you 1000 rupees for it. After that, what will I have to do? I don't have to sit in one place with many computers. It's not that one person will sit and play or watch your video. But one thing is certain, your YouTube channel will get views and watch time. Within one or two hours, your YouTube channel will get 1000 subscribers and 4000 hours of watch time. That is, YouTube can't catch this because your video is actually being watched. But if a lot of traffic comes to your YouTube channel suddenly and then disappears, this method is a little risky, but it definitely works. Now, the biggest question here is, should we use this method? Well, try to understand this in a very practical way. All these views are bot views; therefore, your YouTube channel will never grow in the future. Even if you get 1000 subscribers, or even a lakh, your views will remain the same two or three because all your subscribers are bots. In simple words, you should not use this method at all. If you are a fresh YouTuber, you should grow your YouTube channel organically.  So the best thing is to grow your YouTube channel organically and not fall into these traps.
