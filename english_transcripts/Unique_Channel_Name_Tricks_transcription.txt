Friends, have you ever felt that your channel name isn't right, that it should have been something else? Or maybe you haven't even created a YouTube channel yet and you're searching for a good name? Hello Guys, Welcome to Seekho Official Show YouTube Secrets. Today I'll tell you what a perfect channel name is, how we can search for it, and what things to keep in mind.  What I'm going to tell you today is a 100% free method.  And along with that, you won't just get one or two ideas, but you can generate thousands of ideas from here. First, you have to search "ChatGPT" on Google and go to the official ChatGPT website. And here we have to give this command (referring to a command shown in the video, not specified here). And after you send it, one after another, 100 YouTube channel ideas will appear in front of you. After doing this, I simply press Enter, and a list of keywords will appear in front of me. I can select any one of these. But wait, we have to keep some things in mind here. We also have to see if another YouTube channel has already been created with this name. Keeping these four things in mind, I will check all these names one by one. Like the very first one is "EarnOnline101". And you have to keep in mind all four things I mentioned and check all these names one by one. And whichever name you like, you can keep that name. This video was very short, though.
