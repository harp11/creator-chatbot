Friends, how would you feel if your first YouTube video went viral? I know it's like a dream for all of you, but after watching this entire episode today, your dream is about to come true. Now, whenever someone thinks about creating a YouTube channel, the first thing they do is create a video inspired by a video they've seen. Like, if you watch 15-20 of my videos, you'll think, "I can do this too!" You can't become a successful YouTuber without this. In "Meet Selection," you have to find content that is highly searchable, meaning what's being searched the most on YouTube, or content that's trending. And there's one fact you should definitely know: YouTube wants users to spend more time on the platform.  And if you make a 10-minute video and people only watch 30% of it, its Average View Duration (AVD) will be 3 minutes, which is practically less than the former. So in such cases, YouTube boosts those videos more.  So whatever your first video is, try to make its duration more than eight minutes. In this technique, whatever first video we want to make, we first search that topic on YouTube. Copying means taking inspiration. Whatever video we make should be the best video on that topic. And by "Eagle Eye technique," I mean taking the titles from the videos that are performing best. But these are the three things that, if followed, will greatly increase the chances of your first video getting views. Thanks for watching.
