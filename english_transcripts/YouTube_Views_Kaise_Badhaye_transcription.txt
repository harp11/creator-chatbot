Even after trying everything, are your YouTube channel views stagnant or not increasing? Forget a few views; you'll start getting millions of views on every video. So, don't miss the end. Now let's begin.

Mistake No. 1:  Playing your own video repeatedly. Listen closely, when you upload a video and repeatedly play it yourself or through other means to inflate the views, YouTube's algorithm will detect these as 100% fake views.  Then you wonder why your views aren't increasing. If you do this, stop it immediately. YouTube's algorithm will penalize you and hinder your growth.

Mistake No. 2: This mistake can be very detrimental, especially when you have few subscribers.  Since not everyone who sees your status is interested in watching your video, YouTube understands this isn't organic reach. The result? Your video is limited to only those who received your status and message, not reaching a wider audience.  Whether you upload one video a month or one daily makes no difference to YouTube. But when you start uploading consistently good content on YouTube—with good scripting, acting, and storytelling—your content will gradually improve and promote itself.

Well, those were three mistakes.  Simply go to YT Studio, tap on the video you want to watch, go to Analytics, and then inside the Overview tab, go to the Audience Retention tab to play the video you want to watch.

Hack No. 2: Copy-paste titles, tags, and descriptions from viral videos. Initially, look at the titles, tags, and descriptions of already viral videos and modify them to suit your content before copy-pasting. This method is 100% legal.

Hack No. 3: Keyword research first, then content creation. People usually finalize the topic first, but you should first use Google or TubeBuddy to find trending keywords. Then create videos on those trending keywords. When you provide content based on audience demand, views will automatically reach millions.
