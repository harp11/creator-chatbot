YouTube Creators India uploaded this post on their official Instagram page, explaining why your views are dropping, meaning why your YouTube channel isn't getting views.  I found their approach very impressive and new, and it suggests ways to increase views on your channel.  Your viewers are looking for something else on YouTube. You can create polls in community posts and ask your audience what they want to watch, or ask in every video what topic they want for the next video. This helps you understand their interests.  It's possible your audience is more interested in shorts than long videos, or maybe you're only making shorts and your views have decreased. If you feel your views used to be higher but aren't anymore, or if you're not getting views at all, you should try these things.

YouTube suggests changing your content schedule.  For example, if you upload one video a day, try uploading two, or if you upload one every two or three days because your videos are long, try a different schedule.  I also upload another video on YouTube Secret Show because I know that even if you're creating good content, your audience might not like it. You need to modify your content periodically.

Finally, let's talk about the last and final factor: your channel's homepage. If your channel homepage isn't good, even if a user comes to your channel, they won't subscribe.  After that, you need to showcase your most popular videos in the layout so that they're visible at first glance.  Attract new users immediately and convert them into active subscribers.  If you pay attention to these points on your YouTube channel, your views will definitely increase.
