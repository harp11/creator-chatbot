Friends, YouTube has made five major updates to its platform, which are quite useful for both creators and viewers.  And in the next few minutes, today I'm going to guide you all through all the updates in detail. This update is for viewers. If you see too many shorts on your homepage while watching videos on YouTube, but you don't like watching shorts, now you can avoid this distraction.  An option to hide shorts will appear above the shorts. This update is for creators and is a new launch from YouTube. Now you'll get templates to create shorts, similar to Instagram.  You just have to import your selected videos. This update isn't very big, but it's quite useful. You must have often seen that whenever we check the insights of a video in the YT Studio Mobile Application, the graphs are not properly visible in the vertical screen. This update is quite fantastic and big, and it's for all creators who fall under the artist category. This is today's biggest update because I get many comments and messages asking, "Sir, how do we add thumbnails to shorts? We can't add thumbnails from a laptop or mobile. So how do we add thumbnails?" Now, by clicking on the vertical thumbnail appearing near the title, you can select a thumbnail for shorts. However, the option to upload a separate thumbnail is still not provided here.
