Friend, you won't believe it, I got my first sponsorship when I had only 500 subscribers.  At that time, the brand paid me 250 rupees to promote a single video. After that, I got a second sponsorship.  Not only that, there are people in the market who charge one lakh rupees, two lakhs, five lakhs, even ten lakhs for a single video. This is because every brand wants to promote their product at the lowest possible cost, while every YouTuber wants to promote a product at the highest possible cost. Yes, because all the calculations are based on views, which we will understand further in the video. Now, whether you have few or many subscribers, I won't name anyone specifically, but this is what agencies do. An agency has contacts with many brands and many creators. The agency acts as a mediator; it receives money from the brand, keeps a percentage, and pays the rest to the creator. But don't fall into this trap. For this, you need to know how much to charge each brand, which I'm going to tell you in detail today. So, the rates for sponsorships depend on several factors: your channel's reach, its category, and the kind of videos you make. This determines what kind of brands will approach you. In this whole process, one thing to keep in mind is to see what kind of marketing is most prevalent in the market, who are the people spending the most money on marketing. Some people have 5000 subscribers but get 50,000-60,000 views per video; they can also be paid more.  This depends on the next point, which is average views. If I'm making a well-researched video and my content is viewed by highly educated and mature people, I need to know the type of videos I'm making. Then, there's the option of bidding. You should go to the bidding section, tap on the arrow, and you'll find out how much money people are paying for marketing on that particular keyword in the market. But I'll give you a general idea: if you run a vlogging channel and get, on average, one lakh views, you can charge around 25,000 rupees per brand. Those in the investment category with three to four lakh average views charge at least ten lakh rupees per video.  I think I've told you all the secrets you need to know about sponsorship.
