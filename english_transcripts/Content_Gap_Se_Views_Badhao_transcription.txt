Friends, the competition on YouTube these days has increased significantly, this is something we all know. But think for a moment, if you get to know about such a topic...and today I'm going to tell you this secret of YouTube, how you can find such topics that haven't been made on YouTube, but the audience is frantically searching for them, wishing they could find these videos. To use this tool, first you will open YT Studio. After opening it, you simply have to go to Analytics. And after going there, you will go to the Research tool along with the Overview. This is only shown for short videos. Okay, so if you make short videos, then you will tap on this particular arrow. And all those topics that people are searching for on YouTube will appear. Now I will tell you some things that might confuse you in this particular feature. The first one says, "Earning App Launch." Now, because everyone on YouTube is making videos on "Best Earning Application," "New Earning Application," "How To Make Money Online," along with that, the next keyword is "Play YouTube Channel." Now tell me one thing, what would normal people search on YouTube?  "How to create a YouTube channel," "How to make a YouTube channel," but nobody will search this keyword. YouTube says that your video can run on this. Similarly, you are given different ideas here, but keep in mind that this is for shorts. So how will we find out for videos? And look, as I search, all the tools come up in front of me, which are telling me which videos have been made on this particular topic. But, but, but... like YouTube mobile app, or earn crypto, passive profit, phone app, plate to earn, all apps... Now these were keywords that people are searching for on YouTube but are not finding them. And after coming here, whatever keyword you want to make a video on, like on lack food, on cooking, you will simply search here, and it will show you different related keywords.  I found this tool quite good because this tool has so many features that you won't find in any application, software, or website.
