Friends, the easiest thing on YouTube is getting views on any video, and the hardest thing is making a lot of money with few views.  And earning money is still easy, but consistently earning money is very difficult. If you are a female, you can create sewing tutorials, makeup tutorials. But you'll say, sir, what's special about these channels?  The special thing about these channels is that whether your YouTube earnings decrease or increase tomorrow, if you have a channel on any of these contents, i.e., a service-based channel,  we need to create a YouTube channel that doesn't solely depend on YouTube. We should have a service that we can sell through our YouTube channel. A second business is the best YouTube channel.  Like they promoted their clothing brand, similarly they promoted mobile skins. Or there should be an Application-Based YouTube channel, so that you can get your Mobile Application downloaded through your YouTube videos and generate side income from there. Third, we have Affiliate and Referral-based YouTube channels. If we talk about Sanjeev Kumar Jindal, and for your information, let me tell you that Sanjeev Kumar earns more money through referrals than he does from YouTube. I hope friends, you liked today's content. Thanks for watching.
