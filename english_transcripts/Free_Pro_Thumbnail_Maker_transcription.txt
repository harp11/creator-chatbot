Only using this mobile phone from which you are currently watching this video, you can create thumbnails like these, all within a few minutes.  Since you might not understand the tools, I'm going to show you not one, not two, but three different tools today. These are 100% free and come with many advanced features.

First, let's talk about the easiest tool, one I've worked on for about four to five years. Its name is Pixel Lab. You can download it from the Play Store. It has so many advanced tools, there's no limit. If you look at the text editing features here, I simply add text to layers, and on any text, you'll see all these tools that could take you five to seven minutes to apply in Photoshop. But here, you get everything ready-made. See this central image section? Here again, we have many features: adding textures to images, opacity, color filters. You'll see many different color filters here. Then we have the background layer, meaning the background footage.  Here, we have many options for that too: colors, gradients. It will take time to learn, but once you learn it, you can create thumbnails of any level with its help.

Let me tell you about one more tool before we go, and this feature is my favorite. This application is free of cost and available on the Play Store. You can download and start using it. But now let's talk about today's second application.  As you touch here, a very simple interface will appear. Looking at it, you'll think it's nothing special. But as soon as you touch "new," then you see mm, inches, feet, millimeters, centimeters, meters. Let's just choose okay for thumbnails. A simple, clean interface appears. Even Photoshop looks very simple at first glance, but then when you explore it, many things appear. Let's go back. You're given an indicator for everything here, like gamma or your output. These are very advanced tools, but you can use them if you want. If you scroll down here, you'll find many tools that can be useful to you. You can modify anything using this app.  And here you'll find a wide range of tools that you won't find in other applications – all the features of a computer program.

There's no direct download for this application. What you'll do is go to Google, and after going there, you'll have to do a keyword search.  As you touch, it's similar to Photoshop – it asks what resolution you want. I'll tap here: YouTube thumbnail 1280 x 720 pixels, and we'll create it. How you use it is up to you. But my job today in this video was to show you different tools that are 100% free and allow you to create professional-level YouTube thumbnails.
