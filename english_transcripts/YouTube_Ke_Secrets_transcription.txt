My video got 2.5 million views, and my total earnings from this video... well, it's not just one or two videos, but in today's series, I'm going to show you my entire YouTube channel's earnings. It's going to be a lot of money! So I thought I'd tell you all things that no other YouTuber tells you. Whether you're already working on YouTube or want to start working on YouTube and want to earn money, which is better for you: trending versus evergreen content versus mixed content? The last part, where I showed you my YouTube channel's lifetime earnings, is the most important.
