Technical Guruji's YouTube channel has two hundred and thirty thousand subscribers, and his channel gets around one lakh fifty thousand views.  This means that only 0.6% of his subscribers watch his videos. He maintains two or more channels, you know why? Because he knows that any of his channels can become dead at any time, and at this time he should have a backup channel. Now you should also create a new channel, but the problem is that people are blindly making videos after videos and then saying that they are not getting views. So if you are also a YouTuber who thinks that a dead channel means that no matter how much you try, you won't get views, and if you also want to check if your channel is dead or not, then you have to do a small test, which you can do with me in just 10 minutes. And then after touching the profile, you have to click on YouTube Studio. Now here you have to go to Analytics, and then to Reach. Now here you see, you will find out how much YouTube is recommending your channel. And if it is between 30% and 60%, your channel is about to enter the dead phase, and there is a great need to work on it right now. And if your channel is showing more than 60% recommendation here, you can reactivate your channel. I hope you enjoyed this episode. See you soon in a new episode. Until then, keep watching and learning.
