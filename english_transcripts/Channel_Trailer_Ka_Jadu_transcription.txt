Friends, if you are a YouTuber, then take a look here once. I go to YouTube and search for "Technical Guruji". When you go to their channel, you'll see...  Not only that, if I go to MrBeast's YouTube channel, you will see that no trailer is shown here.  Simply, I touch the channel, and you see there's no trailer. So friends, first we will see what a channel trailer is, then we will see its benefits, and lastly, we will learn how you can use it on your channel.  Then, whether subscribers are few or many, if someone subscribes, what should be shown to them? And if they come without subscribing, what should be shown to them? You can control all this yourself. And the advantage is that "First Impression is the Last Impression." Now let's talk about its benefits. As I showed you the example of MrBeast, if you go to their channel, you'll notice that their latest video is shown here. If I touch and come to the homepage and see their latest video, there's a higher chance they will watch our other videos too.  And at the same time, the engagement of our latest video will increase. But what happened in the case of Technical Guruji? If you go to their channel without subscribing, a channel trailer will be shown; if you don't go, it won't be shown. And once someone subscribes, the channel trailer is not shown to them again. So you too can create a 30-second intro for your channel and put it on your homepage. After touching here, an interface like this will appear in front of you. When you see "Video Spotlight," you'll see two different videos here. And if this option is not appearing in your YT Studio, you can add this feature by touching "Add action," which is shown in front of "Featured Action." So now you'll have an idea from me about how this feature in "Action" works and what its benefits are.
