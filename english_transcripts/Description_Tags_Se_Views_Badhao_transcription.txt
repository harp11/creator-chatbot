Friends, today's video is short but very practical.  YouTube has recently changed all its rules and guidelines.  Earlier, you could use tags in the video description.  So what will we do now? Today I'm going to show you a step-by-step smart way. Using this, you can use tags in the video description. The entire process takes only two minutes, so watch the video carefully and don't skip any part so that you don't face any problems. And I've mentioned something very important at the end of the video, so don't miss it. After searching, you will have to come to this website, which is currently shown at the top for us. And whatever the topic of your video is, you have to search for it here. Now look here, "earn money from facebook" is my video title. I will have to search for the same thing here on RapidTag: "earn money from facebook". And as soon as I search, the website will provide me with all the best tags for this keyword. Now, to avoid this, I will go to ChatGPT and give a short command, which is:  We said that using all these keywords, give us a two-paragraph SEO-friendly YouTube video description where all the keywords should be used. Now ChatGPT will manipulate these keywords in such a way that instead of keywords, we will get an article containing all the keywords from A to Z, which are also shown in bold. Now I don't have to do much, just press and hold these. All three should match; it shouldn't be that the video title is one thing, the description is something else, and the tags are something else. Doing so will not rank your video.
