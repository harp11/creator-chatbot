Friends, on YouTube you'll find two types of videos: one where the creator shows their face, and another where the entire video is made using voiceover and background music.  Lastly, I'll tell you three channel ideas where you can earn a lot of money from YouTube without showing your face or revealing your voice. So don't miss the end.

First, let's talk about channels that show faces.  They've built their audience using their content in such a way that people see their photo on the thumbnail and click. Because of this, even with millions of videos in competition, they get more clicks on their videos. Face-revealing videos also have a trust factor.  Viewers trust the creator, and therefore their videos are watched more.  But in faceless videos, this trust factor is slightly less. If the video is on a sensitive topic, viewers might think you want to maintain your privacy, you don't have a good camera or mobile phone, or you lack a good background. You can create more than one channel, and you can also use AI voice for all this. This allows you to maintain your privacy while earning money from YouTube.

If you don't want to show your face, I'll give you some creative channel ideas. If you pick any of these, you'll earn a lot of money from YouTube.

The first idea is Animated Explainers. You can create a channel like this.

The second idea is Software/App decoding tutorials. If you're an expert in any software or application, you can create tutorials through software/app decoding. These faceless videos are quite popular.

These three are excellent content ideas for faceless channels where you can maintain your privacy and earn money from YouTube.
