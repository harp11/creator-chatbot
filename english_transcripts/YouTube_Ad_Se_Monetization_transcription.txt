Google Ads, which is a product of Google, and YouTube is also a product of Google. So if we spend money on Google Ads and increase watch time on our channel, you can monetize your YouTube channel in two ways. One, by paying money. Second, you can organically boost your channel. And when it gets views and watch time, when you get views from the panel, on your channel, the bots, which are not actual users, which don't actually exist, the bots automatically watch your videos, okay? So you get watch time, you get subscribers through bots. So your YouTube channel will get monetized, but when you increase views on your YouTube channel with the help of Google Ads, means if you run ads worth ten thousand rupees on your YouTube channel and you also complete four thousand hours of watch time on your channel, and you also complete one thousand subscribers, then there was a very big myth that is very widespread in the minds of the audience, in the minds of people today.
