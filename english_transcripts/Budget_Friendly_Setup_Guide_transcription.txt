Friends, for the amount you spend on a single dinner with your friends, you can create videos of the same quality as mine. First, we need to improve our audio quality, for which we need a microphone that can be connected to an iPhone, any mobile phone, or a laptop.  The ratings are good and the audio output is quite sharp. Also, the wire of this mic is quite long. Keep your phone in your pocket or vlog, there will be no problem. If you want a slightly better microphone, you can get this Boya BY-MM1, but keep in mind that many fake Boya BY-MM1 mics are available on Amazon, so you'll have to check their logo. And if you want to invest even more and want a wireless mic, you can order this Grenar G11 mic, which I also have; it has quite good output. But remember, among these three...

After that, to record stable videos, we need a tripod.  A shaky camera will result in poor video frames. So I suggest... this is made of aluminum, but you can also get plastic ones. Because this tripod is very light, and its height is also not very much. Then, if your budget is good and you can invest up to ₹1500, you can buy this Digitek tripod, which provides very good quality and build within the budget.

Then there's this greenscreen behind me. You won't believe it, its length and width are so much that we have used it after folding it twice. And you'll get it for ₹561. But if you don't have good lighting and you want to avoid using a greenscreen in your videos, you can search for "wallpapers" here.  As you search, you'll see you can buy these wallpapers and put them behind you, covering the area visible in the camera frame. So your entire setup will cost you only ₹300-₹400. Its brightness is not very high. You will have to use additional surrounding lights or shoot videos during the daytime. To add a glow to your face, you can use this ring light.
