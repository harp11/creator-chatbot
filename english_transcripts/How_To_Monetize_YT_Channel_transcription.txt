Friends, if you also want to earn money by making videos on YouTube, then first you will have to monetize your YouTube channel. And if you don't know about all the things required to monetize a YouTube channel, today I am going to tell you all the things step-by-step so that no doubt remains in your mind. And at the end of the video, I will also tell you... Friends, first let's talk about the Monetization Criteria, i.e., the conditions after which your YouTube channel will be monetized, after which you will be able to earn money online through YouTube ads. Now, as you can see on the screen, this is my YouTube channel. If I tap on the "Earn" section here, different conditions are shown here.  For example, somewhere it is written that you need only 500 subscribers and 3 videos uploaded, and along with that, another condition is also given that you should have 10 million views on YouTube Shorts, also within the last 90 days. After seeing all this, a new YouTuber becomes very confused. Let's first simplify this, and after that, I will tell you what other conditions are, and how much money will come into your bank account for the first time, and after that, how much money you can earn and when. So, look, to earn money on YouTube, different conditions are given here, which you can currently see on the screen. So look, there are two types of monetization on YouTube: the first is limited monetization, and the second is full monetization. Now, what is the difference between the two? Let's understand this first.  Super Chat means people can send you money in the chat, they can give you various gifts, and you will get the money directly into your bank account. That is, no YouTube ads will run on your YouTube channel here, and even if they do run, you will not get the earnings from them.  For the second one, different conditions are given here. These two conditions are mandatory, which you will have to fulfill. But these other conditions given below, you only need to fulfill one of them. Either your YouTube channel should have 3000 hours of watch time within one year or 365 days. You can start earning online by taking advantage of Super Chat and shopping through YouTube. But if you want to get full monetization on your YouTube channel, and if you have 1000 subscribers, then after that, you have two different conditions to get your YouTube channel fully monetized. Either your YouTube channel should have 4000 hours of watch time in one year. And if you fulfill this criteria by 2025, then your YouTube channel will be fully monetized. But now let's talk about the main condition, without which, even after monetization, you will not get money from YouTube. It's not that once it's monetized, money will start flowing into your bank account.  That's not the case. Look, this is my YouTube channel, and after going here, I go to the earnings section. So here, where you see, it shows you have met the payment minimum. And after full monetization, you can start earning money from YouTube by taking advantage of watch page ads, short feed ads, Super Chat, Brand Connect, and shopping.
