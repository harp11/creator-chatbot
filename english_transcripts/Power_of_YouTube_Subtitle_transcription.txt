If you make videos on YouTube and you don't know about closed captions, brother, you're still living in 2012.  This is a power that can boost your views. This is a power that can boost your earnings. And if you're a YouTuber, you absolutely should watch this episode.  Since I started using subtitles in my YouTube secret episodes, I've been getting very good feedback from all of you. And now I myself prefer to watch videos without audio so that I don't disturb other team members in the office. And you can try this while watching this video too.  A second benefit is that it helps YouTube deliver your video to the right audience because it understands what your video is about, and your video starts ranking faster. That's obvious. But on the same point, the video you made, people in the US and UK also want to watch it, but they don't understand your language.  If you add subtitles in English and upload it as a separate file, in this case, YouTube uses a tool called auto-translate for your video. For all these reasons, you should add subtitles to your videos.  By the way, in this episode, I used the Blink application to add captions.
