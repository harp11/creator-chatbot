Forget the jokes, I'm being serious.  If you have a YouTube channel, immediately stop watching YouTube tips blindly.  Many people are exploiting the emotions of new YouTubers, making money themselves while wasting the time and money of those new to YouTube.

In this episode, I want to first show you the hidden face of some creators who give YouTube tips, and then tell you which ones to avoid.  Currently, one thing is trending heavily on YouTube: short videos about making money.  Because this kind of content goes viral quickly, it will eventually cause you problems. New creators don't know this; they think if a YouTuber says it, it must be true. YouTube channels might get monetized, but after some time, they're deleted for reusing content.

This is just one example I've shared with you all, of those you should avoid.  So, the first question that comes to mind is, "Sir, if this is the case, what should we do?" That's a perfectly valid question, so let's answer it. First, when watching any video, check if the creator has any personal experience.  Only after you confirm that the creator exists and has a background should you apply any tips they give on your YouTube channel.

For example, you can follow the YouTube Creator Insider channel, which is the official YouTube channel for creators. You can also get information from the YouTube blog, which is 100% safe and trustworthy. Or you can watch YouTube-related content on Skillshare, because all content there is team-verified.
