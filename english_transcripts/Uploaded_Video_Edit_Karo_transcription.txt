Friends, just imagine: you've put in a lot of effort, created a YouTube video, uploaded it, and it even ranked well.  But a month or two later, you realize a mistake—a phone number might have been revealed, or there's some other mistake you don't want people to see, or a part you want to trim.  Hello Guys, Welcome to Seeko Official Show YouTube Secrets, Now Let's Begin. So look, first open any browser and type studio.youtube.com in the search bar. After doing this, this interface will appear in front of you. Now we have to touch it, then go to "Content."  Like you touched the three bars, then you touched "Content" here. So we simply go to "Content," and after coming here, we will search for any video we want to edit. First, we'll touch the video, then the pencil icon. After touching here, the entire track of this video will open in front of me. So look, you'll find an option in the left corner, the third one, which is Movie, meaning Editor. You have to touch it here, and you see YouTube's online editor has opened in front of us. You can add audio, add end screens, add info cards—we can do these five things. So look, first we have Trim and Cut. How will we do this?  As soon as you touch here, and this cursor, you can also drag it with your hand, and you can also drag and drop it using the computer cursor. You can keep as much video as you need; you can simply do a preview. After that, we have Blur. If you want to blur a part, you simply touch Blur here. Then look, two options are given: Face Blur, Custom Blur. If you want to hide someone's face, what you can do is, on a particular portion—as you see on my timeline, I've been given custom blur options—and this blur, how many seconds you want to add it for, how long you want to add it, you can customize everything. You can also do this on your mobile phone. After that, we have Audio. If you think something wrong was said in the video, how to edit it? So you simply touch Audio, and this is a pretty good option to hide a wrong part in a video.  Along with that, if you go to the audio list, you'll be given two options. And annotations, meaning adding end screens, adding cards—those are two very basic things; we've learned them many times before, there's no point in explaining them again.
