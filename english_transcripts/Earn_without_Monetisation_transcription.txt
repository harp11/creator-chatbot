Friends, if your YouTube channel is not yet monetized, today I'm going to tell you all the ways through which you can start earning on your YouTube channel from today.  Not only that, if you also want to know what these methods are, then don't skip a single second of today's episode.  Greetings friends, I am Havas Singh from "Sikho Official Show YouTube Secrets," and I welcome you all. Don't skip it at all.

Method No. 1: Affiliate Marketing

What kind of videos can you start making?  Videos in which you do affiliate marketing of digital products or physical products. Now, what are physical products and digital products?  First, we need to understand this.  A physical product means that you go to Amazon to buy something, and you get an actual product in your hand. And a digital product means that you bought something, but it didn't come into your hands. There are many platforms for all kinds of affiliates where you can join affiliate programs and start earning instantly. I will tell you the names of some popular platforms.  I have told people about ACs. What will happen is that if someone purchases an AC through your link, you will get a flat 5-10% commission. Think, how much does an AC cost? 40,000, 50,000. Even 4-5% of that will be a lot. And this is only if one AC is sold.  Imagine how much more you will earn if many ACs are sold, and that too without monetization.  Besides, we don't have many views, who will give us sponsorship? Look, if you create good content in the right way, create content on a particular niche, and create content on good keywords, we have made a dedicated episode on how to get sponsors with fewer views. You should watch that episode; you will understand everything.

Method Number Three: Merchandise Sales

Many people join their live streams, and all those users are watching the videos. Housewife, girls, or people interested in sarees. Now, how does the earning happen here? If you start creating content where you can sell your own merchandise, then you can also start earning money without monetization.

Fourth Method: Crowdfunding

Patreon and many such platforms are there where you can do crowdfunding. Friends, we are not earning money from YouTube, but if you want to support us, you can donate to us on platforms like Buy Me a Coffee.  This is crowdfunding.

If you make paid course videos on your YouTube channel, your videos won't run, but if you do the same thing as a free course, your course will start selling. Let me explain how. If you make a 40-minute video on your YouTube channel on how to use Premiere Pro or how to use VN video editor, and in that, you say that this is just a demo, and you tell people that if you want to see the advanced version of this course, you can purchase our course from the link given in the description. They will definitely buy it.  In the same way, along with your free courses, you can also sell an ebook. I have told you about the course.

Method No. 6: Consulting

If you have a talent with which you can consult someone, whether it's fortune-telling, mobile tricks, or any kind of talent, if you have it, then just...how much will you have to do? And whenever people connect with you, watch your videos, 150 videos, whatever, then you can tell them that you can consult with me directly. Can you earn money from this? Absolutely yes. You might be good at speaking, writing, recording, or editing. In such cases, what can you do? In such cases, you can create talent videos and upload them to YouTube Shorts or in longer videos. As your views, likes start increasingâ€¦ And I believe that whether your YouTube channel is monetized or not, it is your biggest asset that can always earn you money. You just have to be consistent, keep working consistently.
