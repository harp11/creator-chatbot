It took me 3 years to get from 0 to 1000 subscribers, but only 5 months to go from 1000 to 100,000 subscribers.  Not only that, friends, but in those 5 months I earned so much money from YouTube!  So, it's worth thinking about what tricks led to such a massive boost to my YouTube channel.

When I created my YouTube channel, I didn't understand much about YouTube.  So I just made videos on whatever came to mind.  As a result, none of my videos got views.  Then suddenly, a few of my videos started getting some views.  When I carefully looked at all my videos, I noticed a pattern: the videos where I had done thorough research, good editing, and created high-quality content were the ones that performed well.

I also noticed that the videos going viral on my channel were all about YouTube tips or video editing.  From this, you should learn that no matter what content you create, you must target a specific niche. Otherwise, you will see very slow growth.

For example, when I uploaded one video, it got absolutely no views for 8-10 days.  But then, suddenly, it got a massive boost.  From this, you should learn that we should create content on our channel that is unique, valuable, and adds value to someone's life.  And most importantly, our video should be the best among all the videos already made on that topic on YouTube.
