Friend, if you're a new YouTuber or have recently started a YouTube channel, you've probably thought, "I wish I could meet someone and get answers to all my questions."  If you're a user who's recently started or is about to start a YouTube channel but don't know much about YouTube, the next three to four minutes will be very special for you.  I've made today's episode a completely practical guide â€“ how I would guide you if you were sitting in front of me.  See, when you're a new YouTuber, sometimes you think this kind of content will work, sometimes you think no, I shouldn't do this, I should make gaming videos; then after gaming, vlogging comes along.  Will I be able to consistently work on one category? So the first tip is to stay away from distractions and decide on a particular theme and work on it.  The second tip: When you're a new YouTuber, some people, lured by the temptation, spend eight to ten thousand rupees on a thousand fake subscribers and watch time to get four thousand hours.  And then what happens? They've wasted money and haven't earned anything.  No matter how good your videos are, YouTube won't promote them; they'll never go viral.  And the dream of earning a lot of money remains just a dream.  I'll give you a small example: I started my YouTube channel in 2015.  At that time, even without monetization, I got some money. But it wasn't until 2019 that I got my first payment into my account.  But yes, I survived from 2015. But if you're a new YouTuber now and provide good quality, you'll be competing with many YouTubers who are providing excellent quality.  Most important is your video scripting, so that what you say keeps the audience engaged. So many people are making videos on YouTube using these tips and topics that whether your channel grows or not, theirs will.  Just keep these things in mind when making videos, and you'll grow. You don't need any special tricks.
