Friends, this is my student's brand new YouTube channel, created just two days ago. We haven't shared it with anyone yet.  All the traffic is going to be organic. Look here, how you can get so many views on your first video with zero subscribers. And it's not just about so many views; if you follow these tricks, your new YouTube channel will start growing immediately.  Before starting today's episode, I have a very important question for you all. Earlier, we used to make 3-minute videos, and now we make 10-minute videos. Which ones do you prefer?  After clicking here, on our very first video, we've already got 105 views. I'll tab here. After tabbing, you'll see, I'll click on Analytics. And as soon as I click here, you'll see that our entire traffic is 100% organic. And friends, this is the question: how did our YouTube channel start growing immediately? But why doesn't your channel grow? Well, if you also know these 5 things, and the last point is the most important, which you absolutely cannot skip. So don't miss the end. Now let's begin. Point number one is video length. If you see here, let's say you made a 5-minute video, which on average people watch up to 20%, meaning its AVD (Average View Duration) will be only one minute. And the channel gets monetized quickly. Therefore, friends, today's rule number one is that whenever you create a new YouTube channel, its starting content should be more than 8 minutes. And the benefit of this is that if someone watches one of our videos and it's good, our next video is automatically shown below it, and whoever comes to watch one video ends up watching 6-7 videos consecutively. Friends, when you upload back-to-back similar content within a particular niche, it's easier for YouTube to understand what kind of content you want to create, and it helps deliver your content to your target audience quickly. Therefore, whenever you plan a new YouTube channel, Rule no. 3: Audience Retention, which I keep shouting about in every video: increase your video's audience retention! Increase your video's audience retention! But you guys never listen to me. Look at this practical proof. And if I go to Watch Hours, under Analytics, you'll see in Engagement that we have an average watch time of 8 minutes. That means a viewer, on average, watches our 16-minute video for 8 minutes, or 50%. Similarly, if I show you my other videos, look here, let's go to this one, and here, we got quite a good number of organic views. If I click here, you'll see that on this video as well... YouTube doesn't look at the overall retention rate of your video, but YouTube sees how much a video is watched after people stay on it for 30%. And you see here... So remember, friends, whenever you create a new YouTube channel, your first target should be to get the maximum audience retention on whatever content you create. Now comes rule number four, which is very important. If you watch all my videos, you'll notice that the titles of all my videos are almost similar. Note that the tags I've used here, I've used the same tags in other videos. Let me go back, and then back again, and here I'll show you the tags for part 6 as well. First, I found out the top five YouTube channels that made videos similar to my content, and I put the names of those channels in the tags section and description of my videos. And friends, now comes the most important tip of today's video, which is very important for all of you to know: consistency. If you look at this YouTube channel, this made YouTube realize that we are a serious content creator, and we've come to YouTube seriously.  It's a simple thing: if we take YouTube seriously, YouTube takes us seriously. If we don't take YouTube seriously, YouTube doesn't take us seriously. If you follow all these things, your channel will grow very fast. And yes, these were the major tips, but creating good thumbnails, using good titles, creating good content, good scripting... To explain everything practically to new creators, we've created these channels to explain practical things to all of you, so that you can grow along with us.
