My friends, if you've clicked on this video today, then nothing can stop you from creating killer thumbnails, because I'm going to tell you the most important secret about thumbnails.  The main target of a thumbnail is to let people understand what your video is about.  And the most major role in a thumbnail is played by your video's font, i.e., the text, what you've written and how you've written it, and how you shouldn't write it. Where can we download viral fonts that are 100% copyright free? And even more important, can we find out which font someone has used just by looking at their thumbnail? Well friends, I've answered all these questions in this episode.

First, I'm going to tell you the top five viral fonts that you can download 100% free, install on your phone and PC, and start using directly. These are the most used fonts, easy to understand, and look professional. Second, if you want to use Hindi, Marathi, Gujarati, or any other language on your thumbnail, you'll see how the font looks and how it shouldn't look, and then you can download them in one click.
