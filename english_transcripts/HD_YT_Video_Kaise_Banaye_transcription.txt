Now let's talk about Editing and Export Settings. Often, video quality drops because the export settings are incorrect.  Always use high bitrate and high-resolution settings. If you're shooting a 4K 30fps video, your bitrate should be between 40-45.  If you're shooting 4K video at 60fps, your bitrate should be between 70-80.
