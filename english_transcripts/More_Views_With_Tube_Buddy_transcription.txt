Want to boost views using powerful tags, respond smartly to comments, or be the first to know about YouTube's latest updates? TubeBuddy is one of the best apps, used even by creators with millions of subscribers.  Because this app tells you, based on your channel, what mistakes you're making and where you can improve. In fact, it provides some tools that are both free and very powerful. And the best part?  Everything happens right inside your mobile phone. So watch today's episode carefully, and the last 20 seconds are something you absolutely cannot ignore, so don't miss the end. On the homepage, you'll see all your recently uploaded videos.  Touching any video will show you its SEO score right underneath. For example, this video has eight things right but two things wrong, which it tells me to fix. So I know I need to shorten my titles and share my videos on other platforms, which I don't currently do. And as I touch a post, a smart reply will be sent. You can pre-set these canned responses for your channel. This app feature is my favorite because it lets me know about every important YouTube update first.  And you'll see similar news here that can greatly boost your views. You can also filter the news according to your preferences by touching the filter. Now comes the app's most interesting feature: the Tag Explorer. Just tap the menu, then tap Tag Explorer, then tap "Tags," type the topic you want to make a video on, and...  All these were free features you can use. But if you buy the paid version, you'll get even more advanced features.
