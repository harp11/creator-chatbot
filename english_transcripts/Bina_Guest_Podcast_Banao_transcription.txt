Friends, while making a 10-minute video takes two to three days, recording a podcast takes barely one or two hours.  Because it's a format where you just need to use your mobile phone or a PC, attach a mic, and discuss any topic for 30-40 minutes. Because guests will come to a new channel only when you have a lot of subscribers, and how will a podcast run without guests? Don't worry, in today's episode, I'm going to tell you all a fully effective method. First, I'll clear up a big confusion in your mind. People think that a podcast means two or more people sitting together on a set and talking about any topic. But that's not true. Now just pay attention to this and understand all the coming points very carefully so that you too can earn money from podcasts. Method No. 1 Solo Podcast: Whatever knowledge or experience you have, start sharing it in your video. Imagine you're talking to them directly. METHOD NO. 2 Audience Interaction: This is also a very interesting way to start a podcast without guests: interact with your audience, i.e., your fans. Every industry has some trending topics.  You should pick them and discuss one topic daily. Method No. 4 Meet Specified Episodes: Building your podcast around a particular category can be a very smart move. For example, if you create content related to travel, you can find popular topics using tools like Google Trends and Answer The Public. And now let's talk about today's last, final, and most important point: how you can earn money from guests appearing on your podcast. So look, friends, when your channel grows a little... How did you like today's content?  Be sure to tell me in the feedback. Thanks for watching.
