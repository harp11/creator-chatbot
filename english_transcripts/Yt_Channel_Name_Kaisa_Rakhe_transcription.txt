Friends, do you know that this YouTube channel's name used to be "Real Shoot"? Then they changed their channel name to "Real Hit". This channel's name used to be "Belief For You".  People choose any name for their channel and don't realize that a wrong name can hinder their channel's growth, stall their earnings.  I'm going to tell you how this happens, in just a few minutes, so keep watching. Also, in less than 30 seconds, I'll share a trick with you all that will help you find a 100% unique channel name. So don't miss that, and now let's begin.

Let's first talk about why almost all their videos used to show a yellow dollar sign (indicating a copyright claim/issue). That's why they changed the name.  2. Brand Value: A good channel can only become strong with a clean and professional name. What can you learn from this? When choosing a name for your channel, make sure the name is clean and positive. Don't think like just a YouTube channel, but think like a brand.  But now they understand this, that's why they want to change their channel name. You need to understand that you shouldn't choose any name for your YouTube channel in haste, without thinking.

So friends, there were three reasons behind changing my channel's name. First, the name "Tech Triangle" was very difficult to pronounce. That is, if someone asked me what my channel's name is... Second, the name was very difficult to remember, because of which people couldn't properly search for me on YouTube. And lastly, the content I created didn't relate to the name at all.

And if you want to find a 100% unique name for your YouTube channel, then whatever name comes to your mind, search for it on YouTube. Go to the filter and tap on "Channels."
