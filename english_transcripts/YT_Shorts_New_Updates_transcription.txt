Friends, if you create YouTube Shorts, I have two pieces of great news for all of you. After hearing this, you are going to be very happy, because the work we have been struggling with for many days, YouTube is going to roll out such YouTube Shorts features that every Shorts video creator has been waiting for for a long time.  And as soon as they launch, our Shorts will start getting more views compared to normal videos.  Not only that, but what is this update, how can you take advantage of it? Let's know everything one by one.  First of all, we all know that whenever you search for something on YouTube, because of which many people scroll through Shorts, but now YouTube is officially bringing Thumbnails to YouTube Shorts for all of you within a few days, after which you will be able to put Thumbnails on Shorts. After which, through the Browse feature on YouTube Shorts, from Search, this upcoming update, how did you all like it?  Definitely tell me in the feedback. But now let's talk about the second update. This update was so amazing that I was very happy after hearing it. Suppose you are uploading any short, then when you touch the text there, write any text, after writing the text, a voice-over option will appear on the top right side here, and as soon as you touch here, you can pick a speaker, and as soon as you touch the speaker, all your texts will be converted into it. And because YouTube itself is providing this feature, your content will also be 100% monetizable.
