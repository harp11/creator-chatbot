Audience targeting: Are you hearing this word for the first time? If you are a YouTube video creator and you don't know what audience targeting is, then it's very important for you to understand it. I'll explain what it is and why it's important for us, and then we'll start the video.

Audience targeting means that we need to know about our subscribers' habits: who they are, what they want to watch, what content they like, what content they don't like, and all those things. After understanding all this, we will target them.

After opening YouTube Studio, simply tap on Analytics. Then go to Overview, and scroll down to Realtime. Here, notice which type of videos on your channel are performing best right now—the ones getting the most views and subscribers. Then, for our next video, whatever we're planning, you need to carefully look at your top sources of viewers here. In my case, it's showing YouTube Search and Browse features.  Pay close attention to my explanation. If a new audience is showing up, then I can plan my next video in a way that may interest fewer of my subscribers, but that topic should attract traffic from YouTube search.

You should check the tabs here to find out whether your audience wants to watch long videos, short videos, or live videos.  It's simple: if they're watching short videos and long videos, but fewer are watching live videos, then I have to plan my content accordingly—making sure I create an equal number of short and long videos.  If you see that a particular audience segment is the largest, then target them with your videos.

On the same point, if there's a niche that's for people over 65, then you'll target that here. Once a user watches your video through YouTube search, the browse feature, as a subscriber, or without subscribing, I should understand that I need to create content that is relevant to all my previous videos.  That is, if someone watches one of my videos, they should also watch my other videos.
