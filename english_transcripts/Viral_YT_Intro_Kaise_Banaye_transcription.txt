Friends, if I have to make a ten-minute video today, it takes me five to six hours to prepare its entire content.  To make a good intro is crucial because no matter how good your video content is, without a good intro, it will never perform well. Therefore, today I'm going to tell you all three very simple formulas. These three formulas are used by every content creator who has a good number of subscribers and gets good views.  Before understanding the intro, understand that there's a big difference between an intro and a hook. Some people think that an intro and a hook are the same thing, but no, there's a significant difference between an intro and a hook.  An introduction means the starting 30-40 seconds where you give a brief introduction about your video. So, from today onwards, whenever you make any video, you have to speak some lines in the first 6 seconds that are the most solid part of your entire video and the biggest reason to make viewers watch till the end.  If your video is 600 seconds long, keep its intro to only 60 seconds, no more.  Otherwise, your video will become boring.  We must ensure that our intro is very crisp so that people don't get bored watching it. And when your intro is about to end, you should tell people a specific point, like, "In today's video, I've discussed this point in the middle/end which is the most important." So friends, how did you find today's content practically?  Do let me know in the feedback. Thanks for watching.
