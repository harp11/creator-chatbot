Come on, let's see another proof. This is my Neha channel, where I uploaded only 17 videos back-to-back, consistently, and you can see 9.7 thousand views, 4.9 thousand views, then 2.6k, 1.7k. And if you still don't understand, watch this episode completely; you'll learn many things. Hello guys, so I'm back to the official show, YouTube Secrets. Now, let's begin.
