Friends, besides investment and finance, today I'm going to tell you about three channel ideas. If you start any one of these channels, your earnings will be five times higher than normal.

Idea no. 1: Luxury Travel and Reviews

First, let's understand the advantages of this channel, then we'll see what we need to do. If you create this kind of channel and get 5-10,000 views on each video, then first of all, through YouTube Ads (whose CPM for content is very high), your earnings can be up to 5 times higher than normal. Not only that, but if your views are good, you'll get to stay in expensive 5-star hotels. This channel idea is best for those who want to earn money while traveling.  It's a YouTube channel like "Distance Between," which earns only from travel videos, advising on which locations to visit and when.

If you create this kind of channel and it becomes successful, you'll get expensive items from big brands like Havells, Orient, and Bajaj for free, along with product placement in your videos.  Also, friends, these videos are long—meaning one video is 10-15 minutes long—where you can place 4-5 ads in a single video, which significantly increases the content CPM.


To create this kind of channel, along with recipe videos, you'll have to say things like, "This cooker is best, this oven is best," and provide the link in the description.


The third channel idea, I won't explain much, but I'll show you briefly how it works and its earning potential.  So, whatever your interest is, whichever category interests you, create that content, but target the US and UK because their CPM is up to 10 times higher than India's.
