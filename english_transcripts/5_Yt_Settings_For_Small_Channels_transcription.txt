This path setting should be immediately applied by every small YouTuber whose channel has not yet reached 1000 subscribers. Enabling these settings is as important as Gabbar Singh's role in the Sholay film. So don't miss the end. Now let's begin.  It is necessary to do this setting because your eligibility to participate in the YouTube Partner Program is decided based on this. Choosing the wrong country can lead to valuable content of new YouTubers being stolen by some websites and uploaded to their websites, i.e., our videos are put on their own websites. The third setting is channel customization, where most new creators make mistakes. If you check out my YouTube channel, you will find this page very attractive and professional.  Perhaps only one or two tabs are shown to you. Therefore, it is necessary that you go to studio.youtube.com, go to customization, then go to the Home tab, and give your channel a professional look from the beginning. After this, basic features are unlocked, such as adding custom thumbnails. But if you complete YouTube's advanced verification process, you get many additional features. For this, you have to do advanced verification of your channel as soon as you create it. There are three different ways for this: First, verification with Aadhaar or PAN card or document. Second, video verification, which is very easy. To do this setting, go to studio.youtube.com, go to Settings, go to Channel, go to Advanced Settings, and here you will find the Advanced Verification option. And now comes the last and final, very special 5th setting, which is Channel Default Video Tags. In this, you can add the names of your competitors or large YouTubers related to your content, their channel names, in the tags of your videos.
