It takes someone a day, someone ten days, and someone a month to create a final video after researching, skipping, shooting, and editing the content. But it only takes five minutes to do the SEO for that video. In today's episode, I won't tell you how to do SEO, but I'm going to show you, with live proof, what YouTube SEO is, how it works, and its benefits. If you also feel that "I'm making very good videos, but they're not getting views," then look here. Here, thousands and millions of views are coming on every video. This means that when I upload my videos, initially they don't get views, but after a few days, YouTube boosts my videos itself. But if you do YouTube SEO, you will get lifetime views, even when you're not working, because then your videos start ranking in YouTube search. So, if you do SEO, you can also generate passive income on YouTube. Otherwise, you'll keep doing active income like other people.  Third, this is the biggest advantage because doing SEO lets YouTube know exactly what your video is about. And if you get these two benefits, then you can understand how quickly your channel will grow. I hope you understand the power of YouTube SEO.
