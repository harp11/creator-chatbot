So friends, you are working day and night, making videos on YouTube, and one day when you check your phone in the morning, you see an email saying that YouTube has permanently deleted your channel.  It's also possible that you might be making some mistakes on your YouTube channel that are putting it at risk.

The first is hate speech – meaning saying something in your video that shows hate towards someone, displays anti-national sentiment. For example, judging someone by their color, making fun of a religion, or making fun of someone's...

Second, harassment and cyberbullying – making statements in your video intended to threaten or harass any particular entity or group.

Mistake number three, child safety – making statements in your video that could be dangerous to a child's physical or mental health, such as harmful or dangerous acts. For example, showing children engaging in dangerous activities in your video.

Mistake number four, spam and deceptive practices. If you use misleading data when uploading your videos to YouTube – meaning using false titles, descriptions, and tags – you can be penalized.

Mistake number five, promoting scams. You might have seen the web series "Jamtara." Any content where you teach someone how to scam, how to commit account fraud, how to hack – teaching things that are not right in real life, that are illegal – if you teach that on YouTube, your channel can be immediately deleted, and legal action can be taken against you. For example, teaching someone how to crack software, how to create mod APKs, or create fake…

Mistake number six, spam content, repeated content that is wrong and harms the engagement of actual content creators. For example, repeatedly promoting the same thing in your video, repeatedly promoting a false promise. If you use any trick to get fake engagement on your video and YouTube catches you, you could face problems.

Mistake number seven, nudity and sexual content. Statements or videos that promote sexual content. Here, we get a filter on YouTube, the 18+ content filter. If you enable that...

Mistake number eight, harmful or dangerous content. Content created to harm any group or any kind of people, to cause damage, or unintentionally your content could harm someone – your video can get a strike. For example, you innocently performed a stunt in public with a toy gun, but the public watching it got scared thinking it might be a real gun.

Mistake number nine, violent content. Showing excessive violence without any reason, and it's not part of a movie; you're showing it in the middle of a normal video...

Mistake number ten, and many people do this: impersonation, where you are not acting, but seriously pretending to be someone else. It could be a brand, an entity, or a celebrity. For example, an account pretending to be a celebrity. And with the advent of AI, the channel will be related, you will also have to deal with codes.

Mistake number eleven – listen very carefully to these five mistakes that are coming up. Misleading content related to sensitive events. A post that shows incorrect results about an election during election time.  Now, many of the mistakes I'm telling you about today are also made by large news channels.

Mistake number twelve, this is a bit funny and important to tell you. Mysmartspot is a YouTube channel; they also have a vlogging channel where they make vlogs. Once they were making a video in their village, and a funny incident happened with them near a pond in their village. They had no intention of showing them, but by mistake, children appeared in their video, and guess what YouTube did? They gave them a strike for sexual content. So you also have to watch out for this.

Mistake number thirteen, misinformation. If you are making any video on YouTube, and you have tried your best to research good content, but there is content where you have doubts – is this possible or not? First, fact-checking happens, then it goes to a lawyer: sir, can there be any legal action? And only after complete checking is their video uploaded to YouTube.

Mistake number fourteen, "Made for Kids." If the content targets children under the age of thirteen – meaning you make videos with poems, stories – you must put it in the "Made for Kids" category so that your video is shown to young children.

Mistake number fifteen, which is the last one. I see many YouTube channels lifting someone else's video and putting it on YouTube without checking if there will be a copyright claim or anything. The YouTube channel "Ijatress" – this content research took me quite a long time. How did you like the content? Please tell me in the feedback. Thanks for watching.
