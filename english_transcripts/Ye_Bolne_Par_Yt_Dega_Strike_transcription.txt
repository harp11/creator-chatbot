Friends, if you use any of these words in your videos, YouTube may demonetize your video, delete your video, and if you've used these words in multiple videos, today's video is for all those who work on YouTube, whether your subscriber count is low or high, your channel is monetized or not.  This is because if they haven't muted certain specific words, their videos may receive a Community Guidelines strike. This is because YouTube's Community Guidelines have restrictions on sensitive or objectionable content. And if YouTubers use such words, their videos can be demonetized or even deleted.  Let's understand why we shouldn't use these words in our videos. So friends, think, your channel isn't monetized yet, but if you use any of these words back-to-back in your videos... and yes, some people don't use these words in their videos by choice because they know that young children also watch their videos. But if you have to use these words, you will have to add a beep or silence over these words. And now I will tell you which words we should not use in our videos. Second, any kind of hate speech and offensive words, for example, negative comments and discriminatory words, like the N-word or the P-word. Third, any kind of violence-related words or words related to riots and disturbances. After that, you cannot use words related to sexual content or inappropriate words, for example, this, this, or this. And in Hindi, we cannot use any kind of obscene words on YouTube. If you use these words multiple times in your videos, limited ads may be placed on your videos, meaning you won't be able to earn 100%, and only limited ads will run on your videos.
