This YouTube channel isn't monetized, yet ads are appearing on every video.  Another YouTube channel *is* monetized, yet *no* ads appear on its videos.  And a YouTube channel with over a million subscribers, even with monetization enabled, still doesn't show ads. How is this possible? How are ads appearing on that first channel?

Second, after monetization, how did Sandeep Maheshwari turn off ads on his YouTube channel?

Third, if a YouTube channel doesn't have a hundred thousand subscribers but its videos show ads, who gets the money, and why are the ads appearing?  We'll discuss all this today.

Q1. If a YouTube channel hasn't met the 1000 subscriber and 4000 watch time requirements for monetization, why are ads appearing on its videos?  Now, whether your YouTube channel is monetized or not, YouTube will show ads on your videos.  Not only that, if any video on your YouTube channel... (unclear phrasing in original, likely referring to specific ad placement).  Even if your YouTube channel is monetized or not, ads will run on your videos. Then why aren't there ads on Sandeep Maheshwari's videos? You may not know that he doesn't want to earn money from them, and he wanted ads not to show on his videos. Before this policy came into effect, Sandeep Maheshwari hadn't even monetized his YouTube channel.  And after monetization, he turned off monetization on all his videos because, although his channel is monetized, he doesn't want to earn money, so neither YouTube nor he himself will get revenue.

Q3. If your YouTube channel isn't monetized and ads are appearing on your videos, who gets the money? As I said at the beginning, all the money goes to YouTube; you won't get a single rupee.
