If you're thinking about creating a YouTube channel in the USA but are unsure what content to create, in the next 3 minutes, I'll give you three channel ideas that are easy to create and research.

Idea No. 1: AI News Channel

New AI tools are launching every day, and keeping up with them all is difficult.  People often watch YouTube reviews of AI tools before deciding which to use. If you start a YouTube channel reviewing AI tools, people will definitely like your videos.  The best part is you don't need to show your face or record your voice. You can do everything using AI tools.

Idea No. 2: Mental Health

In India, people aren't as serious about mental health as they are in the US and UK.  Lifestyles there are fast-paced and stressful, making depression and anxiety common.  People watch YouTube videos for help with things like getting better sleep.  The great thing is you don't need hours of research for this channel.  Find already popular content and recreate it in your own unique style. If your content is engaging and helpful, you'll get views.  Channels like this often get sponsorships from supplement, wellness app, and fitness brands, potentially charging lakhs of rupees per video if you get good views.  If you think a dedicated video should be made on a specific topic, mention it in the feedback.

Idea No. 3: Personal Finance and Investing

This type of channel isn't for everyone. You'll share finance tips and tricks â€“ how to manage and fix personal finances, and improve investments.  You'll need to edit your videos to be highly engaging. This content has a very high CPM (Cost Per Mille, or cost per thousand views),  lots of sponsorship opportunities, and you can also earn money through affiliate marketing. You can even use AI for voiceovers and editing.
