If it takes me five hours to plan the content of a five-minute video, two to three of those hours are spent just thinking about the video's intro and outro, and the relationship between the intro and outro.  I'm talking about the intro and outro's relationship, not the video hook. I'll bring a dedicated episode on video hooks for all of you; that's separate content.  Greetings friends, a very warm welcome to you all on Havasng Seekho Official Show, YouTube Secrets. Let's learn something new today. First, let's understand how we create videos, or any content on any platform. But if you understand this method, you can surpass others on every platform. Because if you don't know these three things: first, the video's intro; second, the video's main body; third, the video's outro—it's true, right? But the most important thing here is our intro and outro. Let's say you've done a great job in your video's beginning, you've shared great things, but you haven't put anything special in the outro. Whether it's YouTube or any other platform, they all want this: if a user clicks on the video, they should watch it until the end.  But how do we do that? Well, I have three favorite methods that I use in my videos, and you can also use them to increase views on your videos. Look, this is the script of my today's video. You can see its beginning, which I spoke word-for-word at the start, is written here. After that, a little below, introduction; after that, content, main body; then, intro, outro, hook. But I'll explain these step-by-step. Don't disappear! See, when I create the video intro, forget the hook—that's a separate section. Just before our introduction, before the video's main body, we need a paragraph or lines that will take the user to the list of points, and that's what I've done here. First, you have to ask a question whose answer your audience doesn't know. It could be anything, you can ask it based on your content. When you ask a question, the viewer will want to know the answer and will watch your video to the end. Second, you have to create hype and reveal the content sequentially. The first point is the most important, so look at them one by one. When I reveal them one by one, users will have less opportunity to skip my content. After that, the content is built sequentially, so the entire video body will be watched. And because we've presented the most important part at the end of the video, they won't skip that. So, the whole video is watched! Doing this also creates suspense in the audience, which keeps them engaged. You can write this in the intro at the start of the video and then start the video.
