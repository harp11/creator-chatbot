Friends, many of you have been making videos on YouTube for a long time, but neither your views are increasing nor your subscribers.  So, it's possible that your way of working is wrong. What are they doing wrong that their YouTube channel isn't growing? Well, today's episode is on this topic. I'll tell you some points that will help. Now, because I can't check everyone's YouTube channel one by one, I'm going to use my channel as an example to explain how to professionally optimize a YouTube channel. First, let's check from a subscriber's perspective. For that, you need to come to your YouTube channel's homepage, like me, and look at your channel not from a creator's perspective, but from a subscriber's point of view.  The chances are high that they'll click on this video. So, your channel's videos should be your best videos, the ones that make someone want to subscribe to your channel. Now, let's talk about how I would check your channel if it were in front of me. Let's assume for a moment that my channel is your YouTube channel. Because a single channel banner tells a viewer within seconds what kind of videos you make. Then I check your channel trailer video.  This might make someone subscribe to you. Then I go to your video section and look at your videos to see if you've properly optimized your titles and thumbnails. After that, I play any one of your videos and check the audio and video quality. Is there any background noise in the audio? Because if these things aren't right, people who want to watch your videos on YouTube won't watch them. So, I check if you've written a good description in the video description.  So far so good, but there are two things that 90% of people ignore, but they give you a chance to reach 20-30% more new people. Those are YouTube Live and the Community Tab. We'll meet again tomorrow in a new episode. Until then, keep watching and learning.
