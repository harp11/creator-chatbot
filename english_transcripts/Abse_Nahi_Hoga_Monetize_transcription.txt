Friends, imagine you work day and night, creating many videos, waiting for a year or two, finally achieving 4000 watch hours and 1000 subscribers on your channel, and your YouTube channel gets monetized. But if all this sounds fabricated to you, let's first look at the proof.  After that, I'll explain what's actually happening and, most importantly, how you can avoid it. So don't miss the end.

Now, simply put, this is a large YouTube channel with millions of views on each video. Their earnings would be quite substantial. But three months ago, they unexpectedly received an email from YouTube. Rakesh, the owner of the YouTube channel, confirms that he hasn't made any mistakes on his YouTube channel. Still, his channel was demonetized.  The question is why? Because if this can happen to such a large YouTube channel without any fault, why can't it happen to us? This is called invalid click activity, and in this case, YouTube can demonetize your channel.

Rakesh replied to YouTube, appealed, but Rakesh clearly states he made no mistakes. So what caused the problem with his channel? Well, that's the question whose answer you all need to know.  It can happen if, for example, I repeatedly replay your videos on my computer using a US VPN, then a UK VPN, playing one video repeatedly. In this case, your YouTube channel can be demonetized due to invalid click activity.  The same thing happened to Manoj and his wife, Jyoti Sri, whose channel is about YouTube earnings. What should we do if this happens to us?

So friends, if you notice your YouTube channel's revenue suddenly increasing 5 times, 10 times, but the views remain the same, or you doubt that such earnings are impossible, disable monetization on all your channel's videos for some time.  After that, you have to report this to the YouTube team. And after a few days, re-enable monetization on all your videos.
