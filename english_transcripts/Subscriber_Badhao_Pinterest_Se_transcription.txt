Fifty followers are getting a lakh views, so brother, on this page, 500 followers are getting 2 million views. This app gives everyone a chance to do free promotion, but people don't even know about it. And how to promote YouTube videos for free? So watch today's episode carefully, and in the last 30 seconds, something very special is told, so don't miss that. First, from Play Store or App Store, then an interface like this will come in front of you. Now, as you can see in front of me, there are four [images/options]: first Make Money, second Nature, and similarly, two more images are coming. And here I touch the first one. From all this, we get an idea that even posts of new accounts on the Pinterest app go viral very easily, and from those viral posts, we are going to increase the views of our YouTube videos. Before that, just open YT Studio, go to the content tab, and touch the video you want to promote, then touch the edit button, after which you simply have to download the thumbnail of that video which you want to promote on Pinterest for free. After this, you have to open the Pinterest app, touch the plus icon in the center, then touch create pin. After which you simply have to pick your YouTube thumbnail here. Then write something very clickable in the title and copy and paste the description of your YouTube video in the description as well. After that comes the video link. Your video thumbnail should be very engaging, complete in itself, not incomplete. And if it's not engaging, then upload that photo here. And if you do this regularly, the chances of your post getting views increase a lot. But let me tell you a bonus tip: you should share only one link here. This will build your profile's trust, and your other posts will also start going viral.
