Today, in YouTube Studio, this tab was shown to me. In this, YouTube itself tells us how many and what kind of videos you should upload on your channel, which you have been working hard to solve for years. And yes, something very important was told in the last 15 seconds, so keep watching. Hello guys, welcome back to Seekho Official Show YouTube Secrets, where I keep teaching you something or the other related to YouTube per day. Now let's begin. To access this feature, then in the main overview tab, you will find this tab on sliding, which is how to balance your upload schedule. Now, as you touch it, first of all, a very important thing will be told to you, which is that there is no one perfect schedule for all YouTube channels. Round 2 Hell uploads one video in 6-7 months, so the new channel ones upload 40-50 videos in a day. So the uploading schedule depends entirely. Then, as I slide here, I am being asked to experiment with three types of videos. The first is Hub, second is Help, and the third one is Hero. So Hub content is that which is similar to your recent videos and compels all your viewers to come to your videos daily. This content should be frequent, which can also be easy to produce. Along with that, Help means content that is evergreen, which has a very large audience. Well, such topics are very rare, so they should be made with complete planning. Now, on the next slide, we are being told that after this, we have been told that whenever you schedule your content, you need to consider three things. The first one is that you are finding such a balance that you can remain consistent on it. The second one is that you will have to understand your audience. Before making any major change, you have to tell the audience what you are going to change. And the third one is that it's not that if one schedule doesn't work, then give up, but you have to keep experimenting.
