If you also want to earn money from YouTube by making YouTube shorts, then today I have brought five different short channel ideas for all of you, not one, not two, but many. Welcome to Seekho Official Show YouTube Secrets. Now let's begin. Today I am going to tell you five different ideas; from the first channel idea, you can earn $1000, from the second $2000, and so on, from the last channel idea you can earn $5000, that is, approximately 4-5 lakh rupees every month. And I am not joking about anything; I have also told you how you will earn money. Today's idea number 1 is Entertainment and Comedy Shorts, which are the most watched on YouTube.  What is the reason? A small child also watches it, youth also watches it, and elders also watch it. Along with this, due to such a large audience, we will have to create content that can be viewed worldwide. If you make this type of short video, not only will your growth be faster, but you will also earn more money.  If you have a second channel idea on your YouTube channel, it is Health and Fitness shorts. If you have seen on YouTube, nowadays there are many fitness influencers who make different types of fitness videos, like yoga, gym, what to eat, what not to eat. You can guess how much this is in demand from Carry Minati, Bhuvan Bam, or Ashish Chanchlani; everyone is launching their products in this category.  If you get 10-15 thousand views, then brand collaborations will start coming to you. And because of unhealthy diets, everyone's life is getting worse, their daily routine is getting worse.  I am telling you in this Sigma video, there is a new trend on YouTube, on which you get the most earnings, and they grow very quickly. What kind of videos are those?  See it once on the screen, and you have to edit the normal short videos from your mobile phone and re-upload them on YouTube, just like this creator has done. Here, only good editing works, good background music works. If some content comes in front of it that matches its ego, whose result is very shocking or very egoistic, then instead of watching that content once, they watch it again and again and also share it with everyone. And your YouTube Shorts videos start earning as much as long videos. And when traffic starts coming to your shorts videos from the US, UK, etc., and because making this type of video is very easy, you can create a whole month's content in one day. And if you manage at least three YouTube channels, then you can easily earn 3000 dollars. Look, today's fourth method is Tech Gadgets and Reviews.  These are the different types of short YouTube channels you see on YouTube, which review a product with fun. I'll tell you a reality; all these short YouTube channels that review products neither review the product for free nor buy the product themselves. So, even on your minimum views, you will start getting barter deals, i.e., products will start coming, but you won't get money. But if you start getting good views, and any brand, every brand wants its product to be promoted, then they themselves send the products. Personal Finance means how you can manage your money in a better way, and Investing means where to invest, which is the highest earning category on the internet. In this, you will definitely see less growth. So friends, these were the five different categories, if you create a YouTube channel on them, then you will have the highest earnings in your YouTube Shorts.
