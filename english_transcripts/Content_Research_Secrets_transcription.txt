Whether it's any video creation, the first step is to understand what the video is about. If you choose the wrong video topic, no matter how good a video you make, no one will watch it.  Recording a video takes five minutes, editing takes two hours, and uploading takes five minutes. They spend two hours on content research, and 5-6 hours on editing, and then say, "Why am I not getting reviews?" Think about it, even if I speak anything in this episode and do excellent editing, will you watch this episode?  Script writing means deciding what to say or show, and how to show it. So today we will only talk about content research. First, we need to finalize a topic that our subscribers will like, so that every subscriber will come to watch the video on that topic. Now, since we can't directly talk to subscribers, we'll take help from YT Studio. First, go to the YT Studio application. Then tap on Analytics, then Research, and here you have to carefully watch all the videos.  In analytics, tap on the audience tab and scroll down a little. And here, tap where you can see which top videos your subscribers are watching, but they are videos from other YouTubers. Again, from here you can pick whichever you like. Tip number 3: Below this, you'll find a tab showing other YouTubers who make videos similar to yours. Now, simply put, they are your competitors. And if you go to their channels and check their best-performing videos lately...  For Chat GPT, Pinterest, or whatever niche you want to make videos in, just go to Chat GPT and give it this prompt (which I just wrote in front of you), and whatever content you want, Chat GPT will give you 100 ideas. As much as possible, pay attention to the comments on your latest and previous videos, because in the comments, people ask questions that other people on YouTube haven't answered.
