Friends, today we're going to talk about three YouTube channel ideas where the competition is currently very low, but these topics are trending.  The best part is you only need to spend an hour once a week working on it, and you can start making money.  These channels feature educational content presented in such an engaging way that you're compelled to watch the entire video.  Complicated educational topics are made fun and relatable, using motion graphics and good storytelling.  Previously, creating this type of content took 10-15 days, but now AI tools have made it possible to do this in a matter of minutes.  You just need a text-to-image generator tool and an image-to-video AI tool.

Content No. 2: Live Tutorials with Engagement. This could be a completely new type of content for you.  Imagine you want to learn video editing for Reels. You have two options: a ten-minute fast-paced tutorial video, or a live session. Obviously, a live session is better because you get your doubts cleared, and you see each step of the editing process as an editor would perform it. Create live tutorials – whether it's Photoshop, cooking, music production – and you'll create a unique content category.

Content No. 3: Faceless Finance Videos. Learning is multiplied tenfold with this content.  You don't need to show your face or use your voice. You can create fully automated videos using AI tools.  Content ideas include stock market basics, passive income ideas, or personal finance content. If you add an entertainment element to the first technique discussed in this episode, audience engagement will increase even further.
