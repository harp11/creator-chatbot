=== Channel_Banner_Biggest_Secret ===

Very few of you will know that the banner you see on YouTube can increase your earnings, increase your Instagram followers, or even get you sponsorships. So let's learn some new things today. First, the importance of a YouTube banner. Your YouTube banner is not just an image, but your brand identity. Whenever a new visitor comes to your channel, the first things they see are your channel name and tagline so people understand what your channel is about, your upload schedule so people know how often you upload new content, and a clean and professional look so that anyone can understand at first glance what they will find on your channel. Because not everyone watches all your videos or the entire channel the first time. The YouTube banner size is 2560 x 1440 pixels, but the parts visible on mobile and desktop are different. Therefore, any important information or graphics should be placed centrally. You can download this PNG file and place it on your banner. After editing, your banner will look very professional and there will be no cropping issues on YouTube. This allows interested people to easily follow you on Instagram, Twitter, and other social media. Many companies and brands sponsor YouTube creators. The information at the top of the YouTube banner is small, but its impact can be huge. How did you like today's content?  Please tell me in the feedback. Thanks for watching.


=== Usa_Channel_Kaise_Banaye ===

Friends, I accidentally searched "USA channel" on YouTube, and look what came up: "Earn ten lakh rupees a month working from home with Chat GPT plus AI USA Shorts," from a USA Automation channel showing $54,765 revenue, about 45 lakh rupees.  But I suddenly wondered, "Is this even possible?"  Then I started deep research on this topic, and what I found will blow your mind. Today's video is only three minutes long. I've also explained how you can earn money from a USA channel even if you don't know English. So don't miss it, and now let's begin. But what's written on these thumbnails isn't 100% true.  That level of earning is possible, but *this* level of earning isn't.  Such large amounts are written on thumbnails to get more clicks. First, understand that creating a USA channel while living in India isn't as easy as creating an Indian channel. This is the problem that prevents many people from creating USA channels. But don't worry, my friend, I'm here. I'll guide you on how to do it.  First, in settings, you'll have to select USA under region. And in channel keywords, you need to add all keywords related to your content that are most searched in the USA. But honestly, even after doing all this, you won't get views on videos immediately. Because people either make short videos or long videos, because shorts get traffic quickly, and once shorts get traffic, long videos also start getting traffic.


=== Youtube_Analytics_Ki_Power ===

Just as every student who passes any exam has all the exam books, every successful YouTuber has the YT Studio mobile application on their phone. But new YouTubers don't understand this at all.  It's completely wrong. Let me tell you, you can make great videos, but until you understand this app properly, you won't be able to become a successful YouTuber.  You have to pass physicals and medicals in other fields, but for YouTube, where you can earn not just fifty thousand, but lakhs and crores of rupees a month, nobody studies.  You can earn lakhs of rupees.


=== Shorts_Ki_Kamai_Badhao ===

There are two YouTube channels. Both create shorts, both have the same content, and both receive the same number of views. However, one earns ₹10,000 per month, while the other earns ₹1,000,000 per month.  In this 30-second video, I'll show you the best and easiest use of this feature, which you absolutely cannot ignore. So don't miss this.  From one video, I earned ₹8, and from 50,000 videos, I earned ₹30.  And man, at this rate, even if millions watch each short video...  Let's first understand what this new feature is and how it works.  Friends, in any short where you want to use this new feature, just tap on its edit button. After finding the product, you'll need to tap on this plus button.  After that, as soon as someone watches your video and purchases this product, you will receive its affiliate commission. Wait, wait, wait. Let's say I searched for a microphone here and selected a One Dynamic microphone, which costs only ₹2,590. Just imagine, here I'm getting a commission of only 6.2%, which is clearly written here. Think about that, and that's from just one short video! Now, we've assumed only a 1% conversion rate. But even if the conversion rate fluctuates a bit, the earnings from one short are not at all low. You need to start a dedicated YouTube channel within each niche, and then work on it back-to-back. If you build up your YouTube channel in any category, and if you earn all the money here, then you have to remove your link from this place and put the link in the video description – your affiliate link, whether it's Flipkart's or Myntra's.
