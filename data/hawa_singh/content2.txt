This path setting should be immediately applied by every small YouTuber whose channel has not yet reached 1000 subscribers. Enabling these settings is as important as Gabbar Singh's role in the Sholay film. So don't miss the end. Now let's begin.  It is necessary to do this setting because your eligibility to participate in the YouTube Partner Program is decided based on this. Choosing the wrong country can lead to valuable content of new YouTubers being stolen by some websites and uploaded to their websites, i.e., our videos are put on their own websites. The third setting is channel customization, where most new creators make mistakes. If you check out my YouTube channel, you will find this page very attractive and professional.  Perhaps only one or two tabs are shown to you. Therefore, it is necessary that you go to studio.youtube.com, go to customization, then go to the Home tab, and give your channel a professional look from the beginning. After this, basic features are unlocked, such as adding custom thumbnails. But if you complete YouTube's advanced verification process, you get many additional features. For this, you have to do advanced verification of your channel as soon as you create it. There are three different ways for this: First, verification with Aadhaar or PAN card or document. Second, video verification, which is very easy. To do this setting, go to studio.youtube.com, go to Settings, go to Channel, go to Advanced Settings, and here you will find the Advanced Verification option. And now comes the last and final, very special 5th setting, which is Channel Default Video Tags. In this, you can add the names of your competitors or large YouTubers related to your content, their channel names, in the tags of your videos.


=== Viral_Topic_Kaise_Dhoondhe ===

To make a video viral, the topic of the video is even more important than scripting, editing, and SEO. If your video's topic is good, the video will go viral. That is, the topics on which, after making videos, your every video's chances of going viral become very high. Friends, a viral topic is one on which, no matter who makes a video, that video keeps running.  The video just needs to be good, whether you make it or I.  Method number one: But the thing that requires thinking here is that you have to write down all the topics one by one on a single page, and then one by one search all the topics individually on YouTube. The second method is YouTube's own trends tool, which you will find in your YouTube Studio. Like, I searched here "how to find viral topics," then videos made on this topic and their views were shown to me here. Now, these different keyword lists that are coming below, all these are keywords that people are searching for the most on YouTube, meaning they are viral topics. And friends, now comes the best part of today's video, where I am going to tell you all not one, not two, but five such tools with the help of which you can find out many solid viral topics in very little time.


=== Chalo_Thumbnail_Banate_Hai ===

Friends, do you want to create professional YouTube thumbnails but don't have a laptop or a high-end PC? You can create amazing thumbnails using your mobile phone. First, open the Canva app. Click the plus icon, then select "YouTube thumbnail." A 1280 x 720 pixel page will open. I'll show you everything from scratch. To do that, let's close this page. Simply swipe down, and you'll get a blank page.  Search for "background" here; you'll need to go to the photo section. You'll find many backgrounds. Let me pick one. I have many photos; you can import your own.  As soon as I touch it, the background will be removed in one click.  The photo's background is completely removed, but the skin tone and overall quality aren't very good, even in the free version.  If you tap the "up" button, it will start detecting the face and smoothing it in seconds.  Since I'm talking about money, I'll go to "Elements," then "Graphics," and search for "money."  I'll go to the last option, positioning, and bring it to the back.  See, the photo is now behind the background. But our yellow background is completely gone. To retain it, we'll reduce the opacity of the money layer. We'll adjust the transparency so both the background and photo are visible. This effect looks good. Next, we'll add text. Simply touch "text," then "add a heading." I've chosen a font, clicked "done," and positioned it. I've added the elements I want.  See, it took me about 3-4 minutes, but I've manipulated the text and background so everything is clearly visible. You can search for and replace anything according to your theme. I used a money image and added it. I'll go to the "Elements" tab, then "Upload," and import a payment screenshot. This thumbnail is almost ready.  The quality depends on your practice and ideas.
