This path setting should be immediately applied by every small YouTuber whose channel has not yet reached 1000 subscribers. Enabling these settings is as important as Gabbar Singh's role in the Sholay film. So don't miss the end. Now let's begin.  It is necessary to do this setting because your eligibility to participate in the YouTube Partner Program is decided based on this. Choosing the wrong country can lead to valuable content of new YouTubers being stolen by some websites and uploaded to their websites, i.e., our videos are put on their own websites. The third setting is channel customization, where most new creators make mistakes. If you check out my YouTube channel, you will find this page very attractive and professional.  Perhaps only one or two tabs are shown to you. Therefore, it is necessary that you go to studio.youtube.com, go to customization, then go to the Home tab, and give your channel a professional look from the beginning. After this, basic features are unlocked, such as adding custom thumbnails. But if you complete YouTube's advanced verification process, you get many additional features. For this, you have to do advanced verification of your channel as soon as you create it. There are three different ways for this: First, verification with Aadhaar or PAN card or document. Second, video verification, which is very easy. To do this setting, go to studio.youtube.com, go to Settings, go to Channel, go to Advanced Settings, and here you will find the Advanced Verification option. And now comes the last and final, very special 5th setting, which is Channel Default Video Tags. In this, you can add the names of your competitors or large YouTubers related to your content, their channel names, in the tags of your videos.


=== Viral_Topic_Kaise_Dhoondhe ===

To make a video viral, the topic of the video is even more important than scripting, editing, and SEO. If your video's topic is good, the video will go viral. That is, the topics on which, after making videos, your every video's chances of going viral become very high. Friends, a viral topic is one on which, no matter who makes a video, that video keeps running.  The video just needs to be good, whether you make it or I.  Method number one: But the thing that requires thinking here is that you have to write down all the topics one by one on a single page, and then one by one search all the topics individually on YouTube. The second method is YouTube's own trends tool, which you will find in your YouTube Studio. Like, I searched here "how to find viral topics," then videos made on this topic and their views were shown to me here. Now, these different keyword lists that are coming below, all these are keywords that people are searching for the most on YouTube, meaning they are viral topics. And friends, now comes the best part of today's video, where I am going to tell you all not one, not two, but five such tools with the help of which you can find out many solid viral topics in very little time.


=== Chalo_Thumbnail_Banate_Hai ===

Friends, do you want to create professional YouTube thumbnails but don't have a laptop or a high-end PC? You can create amazing thumbnails using your mobile phone. First, open the Canva app. Click the plus icon, then select "YouTube thumbnail." A 1280 x 720 pixel page will open. I'll show you everything from scratch. To do that, let's close this page. Simply swipe down, and you'll get a blank page.  Search for "background" here; you'll need to go to the photo section. You'll find many backgrounds. Let me pick one. I have many photos; you can import your own.  As soon as I touch it, the background will be removed in one click.  The photo's background is completely removed, but the skin tone and overall quality aren't very good, even in the free version.  If you tap the "up" button, it will start detecting the face and smoothing it in seconds.  Since I'm talking about money, I'll go to "Elements," then "Graphics," and search for "money."  I'll go to the last option, positioning, and bring it to the back.  See, the photo is now behind the background. But our yellow background is completely gone. To retain it, we'll reduce the opacity of the money layer. We'll adjust the transparency so both the background and photo are visible. This effect looks good. Next, we'll add text. Simply touch "text," then "add a heading." I've chosen a font, clicked "done," and positioned it. I've added the elements I want.  See, it took me about 3-4 minutes, but I've manipulated the text and background so everything is clearly visible. You can search for and replace anything according to your theme. I used a money image and added it. I'll go to the "Elements" tab, then "Upload," and import a payment screenshot. This thumbnail is almost ready.  The quality depends on your practice and ideas.

=== Stop_Making_Long_Videos ===

After watching this episode, you'll all say the same thing: "STOP MAKING LONG VIDEOS!" But why? You'll find out in a little while. But if you are a YouTube video creator, or want to be one, then I'll show you something.  I'll show you step by step. Now look here. This video I uploaded two weeks ago has almost 3K views. I'm opening the YouTube app in front of you all. Now look here, what's the first thing I see? Shorts videos, and not just one, but four at a time. And after two long videos, you're shown four short videos. Then if you scroll further, you'll see again, after two or three videos, four short videos are shown. Shorts videos mean long videos are, in a way, hidden among the short videos. And that was fine until... my mind was blown when I went to the trending page.  80% of the channels that are creators, creators on the rise, are short video channels.  And this is the reason why YouTube short video creators are getting 3-4 million subscribers in 2-3 months. The answer is YouTube's algorithm. Currently, YouTube's algorithm is boosting short videos more than long videos. And if you're also a YouTube video creator... we'll meet again tomorrow in the next episode. Until then, keep watching and keep learning.


=== Content_Calendar_Banana_Seekho ===

Friends, if you work anywhere or have work done, you already know when you have to go to the office, what work to do, and you have a full calendar.  Recently, my manager told me that if I want to grow on YouTube, I need to create my calendar: when to upload which video, what kind of videos to upload, and how to utilize YouTube's features. This episode is about my calendar and all of this in detail. Hello guys, welcome to Seekho Official Show YouTube Secrets. Now let's begin. So first, we'll download Google Sheets from Play Store. I'll create one for all of you.  An interface like this will appear in front of me, meaning many sheets will open. Now what I have to do here is go to the start, and the current date is 2024. After doing this, write it and stretch it down like this. And here, by touching anywhere on it, we'll tap autofill. Then all the dates will be written. After doing this, I have to see how much time I have. Do I have one hour, two hours, three hours a day? And I have to figure out how many videos I can make in how much time. Now let's assume that you need to create a calendar for yourself or I need to create one for my YouTube channel, how will we do it?  So we have to create a calendar where everything is optimized. So we simply write CEYT, then a hyphen, and here we write L. L means Long Videos. This means we want to upload a long video on that day. After that, in the next section, we'll write CEYT-S. This means we want to upload a short video on that day.  If I want to upload a short video one day and not the other, then you can write NULL here, select both, and drag it down. And after bringing it down, tap autofill. Then you'll have a complete list. As you all know, when we tap the plus button on the YouTube app, four options appear: Video, Live, Shorts, and Post. So here I will write them one by one. First day: Creation, Second day: Critique, Third day: Poll, Fourth day: Image, Fifth day: Lifestyle. And after doing this, touch the topmost one and drag it down.  And since we know that if we do any task for 21 days, we get used to it, you just have to create a good calendar and follow it for 21 days.


=== Best_Time_To_Upload_Shorts ===

If you create YouTube Shorts, you must have wondered when is the best time to upload them. Let's begin.  Straight to the point: First, I go to my YT studio, then to the 'Content' tab, and then to 'Shorts'.  You'll see that I've only made 3 shorts on my channel, which have received decent views. Now, I'll click on the first short and go to its insights to show you how upload timing affects a short's performance. See, this short video has received 57,000 views, and if I show you the graph of its first 24 hours of views, you'll see I uploaded it at 9 PM.  That night, the short received 1035 views. You'll see that initially, the video got absolutely no views, but then it suddenly boomed.  From this, I got an idea that short videos don't get views initially. Now, I uploaded this video at 9 PM, but let me show you another video that I uploaded early in the morning. This short video has received 100,000 views, at a time when there is very little active traffic. But if I go to its first seven days' performance, you'll see that the views are similar to the previous video. Whether you upload at 12 AM or 3 AM, if your content is good, YouTube will definitely push it.


=== Youtube_Se_Kamai_Ke_Secret ===

Friends, the easiest thing on YouTube is getting views on any video, and the hardest thing is making a lot of money with few views.  And earning money is still easy, but consistently earning money is very difficult. If you are a female, you can create sewing tutorials, makeup tutorials. But you'll say, sir, what's special about these channels?  The special thing about these channels is that whether your YouTube earnings decrease or increase tomorrow, if you have a channel on any of these contents, i.e., a service-based channel,  we need to create a YouTube channel that doesn't solely depend on YouTube. We should have a service that we can sell through our YouTube channel. A second business is the best YouTube channel.  Like they promoted their clothing brand, similarly they promoted mobile skins. Or there should be an Application-Based YouTube channel, so that you can get your Mobile Application downloaded through your YouTube videos and generate side income from there. Third, we have Affiliate and Referral-based YouTube channels. If we talk about Sanjeev Kumar Jindal, and for your information, let me tell you that Sanjeev Kumar earns more money through referrals than he does from YouTube. I hope friends, you liked today's content. Thanks for watching.


=== 1_Click_Me_Advance_SEO ===

Friends, today I've brought an amazing tool for all of you.  Just look here. I just have to write what I want to make a video about, and as I search, you can see here, I only wrote "how to grow on youtube," and it told me that the title isn't right; I should use "how to grow on youtube fast." If you use this, you'll get better responses. You can copy it in one click and paste it into your YouTube video. Below that, it shows what keywords and text to use.  Below that, it shows what your video script should be. You can see here; it will show you everything, and then it will show you thumbnails. After going to the Play Store, you have to download the application, which is U-TOOLS-SU-TOOLS. As soon as you download it, this interface will appear. If you use this, your views will start increasing even more, and you'll get 100% SEO-friendly titles, tags, descriptions, and much more. So, don't skip the last minute. In Open VT, you can open YouTube and extract the tags of any video to see what tags they've used.  Along with that, in Paste URL, you can…  Look, I'm simply going to Open VT, and I'll have many videos here. Okay, this is my homepage. Now, let's say I tap on this video, then tap on share. This gives us an idea of what tags our competitors are using in their videos. Along with that, you can select and copy any tag you want. I simply tap here and write whatever title I want for my video. After that, whichever country you want to target your video in… Along with that, I'm also shown different recommended keywords, whose score is also shown here, and I'm given many topic ideas.  It's not just a few; there are many.  And whatever topic you search for, you'll be given hundreds of different keyword ideas. Now, whichever keywords you like… let's say this one, this one, this one, this one… Now, look what we do; we go back, and after coming back, I'll tell you about the third tool shown last; I'll tell you some secrets, so stay tuned for that video. As I search for "Photoshop Tutorial for Beginners," I've also made a video on this topic. I don't know if it's showing up in the search or not. Yes, that video is showing up in the search. Now, what we'll do is… here's our video. Now, whatever keyword you want to check your video's ranking for, you have to copy that keyword and paste it into the application.  It's telling me that the video is not in the top 100, which is completely wrong. Now look, some application… this needs to be criticized. The current problem with this application is that it's not showing the correct ranking. If I write "India" here, it will tell me what content is currently trending in India. If I want to target any country, I'll write it here, and it will show me the trending content for that country. Here, whatever video you want to make, you'll simply write it. For example, I write "How to make roti," okay? And as we search for this topic, title suggestions are given to me. If you're watching this video a day or two later, thumbnails will also be shown. Along with that, we shouldn't leave everything to AI. I told you I'd tell you a secret that you need to keep in mind. So, you have "how to make roti" here; it's come the same, the title has become better, and you'll be provided with a better description because this time you gave a very good command. And in this way, you can copy and paste repeatedly…
