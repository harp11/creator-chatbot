=== Upload_1_Video_on_2_Channel ===

My latest video features a video that's performing exceptionally well. If I go to the Misho videos, you'll see its retention rate is incredibly high.  Many videos have been uploaded there, but we haven't seen much growth. However, if a new YouTube channel sees growth, why not download all the videos and upload them to a new YouTube channel?  You're not wrong to think that; you can do it, but keeping many things in mind. In today's episode, I'm going to address three of your biggest doubts. And in the last 30 seconds, I'll show you how to upload a single YouTube video to not just two, but three, four, or as many YouTube channels as you want.

Doubt number one: Can we re-upload videos, meaning to a new YouTube channel, without YouTube saying anything?  And that channel might get monetized initially, but after some time, your YouTube channel might get demonetized. But there's a way to bypass this, which I'll discuss later. See, sometimes when you upload a video to YouTube, your content becomes public domain, and anyone can use it. So, technically, we can't upload the same video to two different channels, right?

If I'm using screen recording, I can change the screen recording position, change the background, and slightly alter the overall video length (a second or two). In this case, there's a 99% chance you won't get any kind of strike. But we've already tried this, and many YouTubers upload different variants of the same video.

First, you can't directly re-upload content to another YouTube channel without making any modifications.

Third, if you want to re-upload content—to earn money from the same video two or three times—you'll have to create different variants of it.


=== Uploaded_Video_Edit_Karo ===

Friends, just imagine: you've put in a lot of effort, created a YouTube video, uploaded it, and it even ranked well.  But a month or two later, you realize a mistake—a phone number might have been revealed, or there's some other mistake you don't want people to see, or a part you want to trim.  Hello Guys, Welcome to Seeko Official Show YouTube Secrets, Now Let's Begin. So look, first open any browser and type studio.youtube.com in the search bar. After doing this, this interface will appear in front of you. Now we have to touch it, then go to "Content."  Like you touched the three bars, then you touched "Content" here. So we simply go to "Content," and after coming here, we will search for any video we want to edit. First, we'll touch the video, then the pencil icon. After touching here, the entire track of this video will open in front of me. So look, you'll find an option in the left corner, the third one, which is Movie, meaning Editor. You have to touch it here, and you see YouTube's online editor has opened in front of us. You can add audio, add end screens, add info cards—we can do these five things. So look, first we have Trim and Cut. How will we do this?  As soon as you touch here, and this cursor, you can also drag it with your hand, and you can also drag and drop it using the computer cursor. You can keep as much video as you need; you can simply do a preview. After that, we have Blur. If you want to blur a part, you simply touch Blur here. Then look, two options are given: Face Blur, Custom Blur. If you want to hide someone's face, what you can do is, on a particular portion—as you see on my timeline, I've been given custom blur options—and this blur, how many seconds you want to add it for, how long you want to add it, you can customize everything. You can also do this on your mobile phone. After that, we have Audio. If you think something wrong was said in the video, how to edit it? So you simply touch Audio, and this is a pretty good option to hide a wrong part in a video.  Along with that, if you go to the audio list, you'll be given two options. And annotations, meaning adding end screens, adding cards—those are two very basic things; we've learned them many times before, there's no point in explaining them again.


=== Instant_Earning_Shorts_Ideas ===

Friends, if you also want to earn money from YouTube by creating YouTube Shorts but you can't wait too long and you are looking for some ideas on which if you make Shorts, your instant earnings will start instantly. Hello guys, I am Hawasing and welcome to Seekho Official Show, YouTube Secrets. Now let's begin.  Once you see this YouTube channel, you'll see what they are doing on their YouTube channel.  Whatever phone they are making this video on, the company that makes this product, they have sent them all these things for free, and along with that, they have also given them money, saying, "Sir, make a video about us on your YouTube channel." But that's not what I want to tell you. Rather, the point is that they earn a lot more money than all these things, which is affiliate marketing.  Whatever product they are making a video about, it has their affiliate link, and the meaning of their affiliate link is that if any user, after watching their video, buys any product through their link, they get a direct commission, which is between the 27th and 28th of every month. They start uploading their videos creatively. You don't have a product, don't worry. Watch this one video of mine where I earned money from Amazon and Flipkart. My YouTube channel wasn't monetized, meaning I only earned money from affiliate marketing at that time, which you can also earn. So today's idea number one is this, whether your YouTube channel is monetized or not. Now friends, let's talk about today's second YouTube channel idea, through which 90% of you can earn money if you want to. Whatever you know, start making videos about it, and also start giving your mobile number in every video. Even if you don't know much, you must know video editing if you want to be a content creator. You can start online earning by providing editing services. You will have to create a Shorts YouTube channel, and you can make Sigma Shorts here, which are going viral on YouTube right now, at the time I'm making this video. Or someone has given a funny reply. That is, a sharp answer should be given within that reply. If you make this type of video and add good visuals and good SFX, and I have integrated this third idea because if you make Sigma videos on your YouTube channel, your videos will grow fastest at this time.


=== More_Views_With_Tube_Buddy ===

Want to boost views using powerful tags, respond smartly to comments, or be the first to know about YouTube's latest updates? TubeBuddy is one of the best apps, used even by creators with millions of subscribers.  Because this app tells you, based on your channel, what mistakes you're making and where you can improve. In fact, it provides some tools that are both free and very powerful. And the best part?  Everything happens right inside your mobile phone. So watch today's episode carefully, and the last 20 seconds are something you absolutely cannot ignore, so don't miss the end. On the homepage, you'll see all your recently uploaded videos.  Touching any video will show you its SEO score right underneath. For example, this video has eight things right but two things wrong, which it tells me to fix. So I know I need to shorten my titles and share my videos on other platforms, which I don't currently do. And as I touch a post, a smart reply will be sent. You can pre-set these canned responses for your channel. This app feature is my favorite because it lets me know about every important YouTube update first.  And you'll see similar news here that can greatly boost your views. You can also filter the news according to your preferences by touching the filter. Now comes the app's most interesting feature: the Tag Explorer. Just tap the menu, then tap Tag Explorer, then tap "Tags," type the topic you want to make a video on, and...  All these were free features you can use. But if you buy the paid version, you'll get even more advanced features.
